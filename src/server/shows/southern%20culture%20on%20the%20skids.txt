shows are 18 years and older. If you are under 21 you are subject to a $5 surcharge. The surcharge must be paid in cash at the door on the day of the event.The Chapel Hill, NC trio Southern Culture On The Skids has been spreading the rock and roll gospel since 1983. Rick Miller &#8211; guitar/vox, Mary Huff &#8211; bass/vox and Dave Hartman &#8211; drums, play a greasy mix of surf, rockabilly, R&amp;B and country fried garage with a side of psych. It&#8217;s a musical gumbo Miller calls, &#8220;Americana from the wrong side of the tracks.&#8221; For over 30 years, the band have toured everywhere from the NC Prison System to Mt. Fuji, Japan, delivering what Rolling Stone calls &#8220;a hell raising rock and roll party.&#8221; Since 1983, when they formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, SCOTS have played their unique hybrid of Americana, surf, R&amp;B, rockabilly, and swamp pop (the band describes their sound as &quot;toe sucking geek rock - kinda weird, but it feels good when you&#39;re doing it&quot;), all the while driving fans into ecstatic, sweatdrenched paroxysms of joy. Assisted by his cohorts in chaos &#8212; drummer Dave Hartman and bassist/singer/heartbreaker Mary Huff &#8212; Miller and crew have been prolific and ubiquitous for over twenty years.&nbsp;http://www.scots.com&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/southerncultureontheskids&nbsp;","artists":[{"id":7181,"name":"Southern Culture on the

7:30 / Show 8\nSouthern Culture On The Skids has been spreading the rock and roll gospel since since they formed in Chapel Hill, NC in 1983. Guitarist/singer Rick Miller, drummer Dave Hartman and bassist/singer/heartbreaker Mary Huff, play a greasy mix of surf, rockabilly, R&B and country-fried garage with a side of psych, all the while driving fans into ecstatic, sweat-drenched paroxysms of joy. It's a musical gumbo Miller calls, \"Americana from the wrong side of the tracks.\" The band has been prolific and ubiquitous for over thirty years, touring everywhere from the North Carolina Prison System to Mt. Fuji, Japan and delivering what Rolling Stone calls \"a hell raising rock and roll party.\"\nSouthern Culture On The Skids' newest album, The Electric Pinecones, was released on September 16, 2016. It's the band's fifth album on their own label, Kudzu Records. The album features 12 original SCOTS tunes - 11 brand new songs and a whole-lotta NOLA remake of the SCOTS classic, “Swamp Fox - The Original.“ All the tunes were produced and recorded at Rick's studio in NC, The Kudzu Ranch.\n \nTICKET INFORMATION \n• Slim's is an ALL AGES (6+) venue.\n• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

The surcharge must be paid in cash at the door on the day of the event.http://www.scots.com/https://www.facebook.com/southerncultureontheskidsSouthern Culture On The Skids has been spreading the rock and roll gospel since since they formed in Chapel Hill, NC in 1983. Guitarist/singer Rick Miller, drummer Dave Hartman and bassist/singer/heartbreaker Mary Huff, play a greasy mix of surf, rockabilly, R&amp;B and country-fried garage with a side of psych, all the while driving fans into ecstatic, sweat-drenched paroxysms of joy. It&#39;s a musical gumbo Miller calls, &#8220;Americana from the wrong side of the tracks.&#8220; The band has been prolific and ubiquitous for over thirty years, touring everywhere from the North Carolina Prison System to Mt. Fuji, Japan and delivering what Rolling Stone calls &#8220;a hell raising rock and roll party.&#8220;&nbsp;KOLARShttp://kolarsband.com/When it became clear that glam folk act He&#8217;s My Brother She&#8217;s My Sister was heading towards a hiatus,&nbsp;band members Rob Kolar and Lauren Brown decided to go off and find their own beat. What they learned from their previous outfit was that even folk fans want to find music that makes them move. That&#8217;s the dictum that&#8217;s guided the duo into the creation of KOLARS.&nbsp;As KOLARS, the pair create a kinetic brand of disco-inspired rockabilly they loving dub glam-a-billy. Kolar provides the soaring, fuzzy&nbsp;guitars while Brown pounds and literally stomps the percussion&nbsp;&#8212; she actually stands and&nbsp;tap-dances on a bass drum. Far from a gimmicky trick, the clacking feet add&nbsp;familiar moments one might expect from&nbsp;a hi-hat or the clapping of hands. Even without Brown&#8217;s unique method of performing, the band&#8217;s sound remains&nbsp;uniquely driving.&nbsp;Take their latest single &#8220;One More Thrill&#8221;. Crafted like a grooving &#8217;70s country song carved out of the gleaming vibrations of modern rock, the track pulsates right into your chest. It takes your heart by the hand and leads you to the dance floor, daring you to not feel motivated to dance, shimmy, just escape the mundane.&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;One More Thrill&#8217; is about someone who wants to break free from the monotony in their life to pursue their dreams,&#8221; the band tells&nbsp;Consequence of Sound. &#8220;The video uses imagery and creatures to symbolize that struggle and the excitement of taking that chance.&#8221;","artists":[{"id":7181,"name":"Southern Culture on the
