Caroline is signed to Starstruck Records in Nashville, TN. She is managed by Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Entertainment, the home to Reba McEntire, Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson. She is a client of the William Morris Endeavor Agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline has been on a two year international tour with Reba McEntire. Reba first saw Caroline perform at the famed Bluebird Cafe in Nashville five years ago. The two have been working together ever since.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>&ldquo;I have so many incredible memories of my time on the road with Reba. But one stands out &ndash; I was on the side of the stage and I made the sign of a heart to her just before she walked on stage, and she pointed at me and mouthed &lsquo;I love you!&rsquo; Yeah&hellip;that actually happened. Oh, and I&rsquo;ve come to learn her band members are quite the practical jokers too!&rdquo;</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline has been balancing life as a professional musician and high school student for the past four years. She will graduate in May 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I have mixed emotions about high school coming to an end. But I am ready to focus full time on my music. I am also ready to sleep in past 6 am.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline released her first self-titled studio album in 2013. On the day of its release, it broke the iTunes Country Album Top 40, and iTunes dubbed her release, &ldquo;New and Noteworthy.&rdquo; The first single, &ldquo;Money To Me&rdquo; was featured nationwide on Sirius XM, where Caroline was named a &ldquo;Highway Find&rdquo; Artist. The video for &ldquo;Money To Me&rdquo; debuted at #1 on the CMT Pure 12 Pack Countdown, and went on to hold the top spot for several weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second release from the album, &ldquo;If He&rsquo;d Ever Look Up,&rdquo; also took the #1 spot on the same CMT Countdown. CMT has named Caroline a featured &ldquo;Listen Up&rdquo; Artist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline was born in Houston, Texas and raised in Florida. She got her first guitar at age 8, and began songwriting soon after. She performed under the stage name Suite Caroline until 2012, when she changed her name to Caroline Kole just before opening a show for Blake Shelton in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Caroline was 14, her original songs caught the ear of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where she signed a publishing and artist development deal. Caroline&rsquo;s guitar playing abilities have lead to an endorsement deal with the venerable Martin Guitar Company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Caroline is not on the road with Reba, she and her band play coast to coast, and they have opened for artists such as Blake Shelton, Martina McBride, Eric Church, Alan Jackson and Charlie Daniels. Her music is also featured on the DVD promoting the Warner Brothers film, Dolpin Tale, as well as the sequel Dolphin Tale 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>19 year old Riley Bria took the country by storm on Season 14 of American Idol, and finished in the top 24.&nbsp;He was born and raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
