The new owner is named Craig.  We do not like him, let's just put it that way.\n\nThis will also be the official 'Bear & Bulls' Vinyl release show! We just got the new vinyl records in along with a new t-shirt design by our very own Spence.\n\nMake sure you get your tickets early!

STONE FOXES\nIt's been decided, we don't wanna be anything but a Rock n Roll band. We wanna hit hard, go fast, get low, get moody, and just do what feels good. We are on a mission to bottle up all the energy, the impressive amount of sweat, and the outrageous fun we have playing live, and give it back to the rest of the humans as a record. We're six dudes who believe that Rock n Roll can move mountains, and we're gonna play it till we move one.\n\nA mainstay of the Petaluma Rock scene, THE GRAIN has gained notoriety with local music lovers who flock to Sonoma County's best venues to get down with P-Town's most powerful quartet. Guitarist and songwriter, Pete Delaney, has played his special blend of Rock and Blues up and down the West Coast for over two decades. He is backed by the one and only Graham Stearns on bass, guitarist extraordinaire, Erik Stieg, and the funky drummer, Sean England. The Grain's music consists of a balance of well crafted original songs and classic cover tunes that often lead into extended solos and jams creating a musical environment that engages both the mind and body.","artists":[{"id":171913,"name":"Stone

Stone Foxes are popular enough in their hometown of San Francisco to pack the legendary Fillmore Auditorium; the rest of the country is catching on one sweaty gig at a time. Besides winning them opening spots for top-drawer acts like the Black Keys, ZZ Top and Cage the Elephant, the Foxes’ unreconstructed garage-rock swagger has been featured in ads for lifestyle-appropriate outlets like Jack Daniels' King Bee ads and TV’s Sons of Anarchy. It’s also splayed all over the quintet’s four studio LPs since their 2008 debut, including this year’s Twelve Spells. Not bad considering front man Shannon Koehler has had 11 open-heart surgery operations, although given the amount of energy the Foxes put into their songs, that number does make sense.","artists":[{"id":171913,"name":"Stone

Sunday (Rock 'n Roll / Americana)Nectar & The PBJ Present:THE STONE FOXESwith Vaudeville Etiquette$12adv / $16dos8pm doors9pm show21+\nNectar Lounge412 N 36th Stwww.nectarlounge.com\nTHE STONE FOXES\n\n\nThe Stone Foxes are San Francisco's rock band.  They bear the torch of their predecessors with the knowledge that rock 'n roll can move a new generation. They’ve played in front of thousands at festivals like Outside Lands and Voodoo Fest, they’ve headlined the legendary Fillmore Theater in their hometown and they have supported acts like The Black Keys, Cage the Elephant and ZZ Top.  Now, with the release of their fourth album, Twelve Spells, they have solidified a place in their City's rich rock 'n roll history.  \nFounded by brothers Shannon (vocals/drums/harp) and Spence Koehler (guitar/vocals), who came from the Sierra Nevada foothills near Tollhouse CA, The Stone Foxes started back in the Koehler’s SF State days in the Sunset District of San Francisco. Two weeks before they went on tour in 2011, they decided they needed a keyboard player and they added Elliott Peltzman from Fairfax CA to play for a couple months...but he never left. They needed another drummer who could also play bass and guitar for tour in 2013, so Shannon called his high school friend Brian \"The Buffalo\" Bakalian...he never left either.  Their old friend Vince Dewald came in to jam one day later on that year, and after the Indiana kid started singing, playing his lefty guitar, and his brother's right handed bass upside down, it was a done deal.  Finally in 2014, after convincing(basically begging) Vince's old bandmate to move back from his home town of Boston, Ben Andrews came out to play guitar and violin.  After their first practice with Ben, the circle was finally complete and they had beers at the Lone Star tavern on Harrison Street to celebrate their new found brotherhood. \nThe Stone Foxes are an experience to dive into, to get wild with, to sweat with.  \"The Stone Foxes have an energetic style that's rooted in swampy, foot-stomping rock...ambitious arrangements with diverse moods ranging from acoustic twang to thunderous electric-guitar riffs.\"– NPR/WXPN \"WORLD CAFE\"\nInvoking the audience with their commanding stage presence, even jumping down into the crowd if the mood strikes. Their fans know they are in for something action packed and they light a fire in the band, just as the band spreads fire back into them. Guitarists digging in, lead vocals changing between two unique voices with impassioned nuance, and keyboard and organ sounds that fill the space with smoke and burning embers. There are crunchy drum tones, wailing harmonica draws and violin cries that can silence even the most raucous of rooms. But this is not a sit-down-and-watch kind of event. Like Elvis once said about rock n roll, “If you feel it, you can’t help but move to it.” The Stone Foxes' live show brandishes this kind of dynamic passion on stage.  It's impossible not to feel it.\nWith the release of Twelve Spells, the band has chronicled their new beginning.  \n\"Garage rock gold...the sound of a band hitting their stride.”\n– PANDORA\n“Perfect back-to-basics rock”\n– ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY\nThe sounds they are creating are new with tinges of western darkness, punk, surf, and americana, but are strongly tied together by their everlasting rock 'n roll core.  Lyrics about gentrification, income inequality, romance, and heart surgeries pour out of their stream of consciousness.  It's a fresh rock 'n roll album that chronicles the years of their unification, taking on the issues of their lives and our times.    \n\"Driving this Weekend?  Listen to Twelve Spells by The Stone Foxes...Time will fucking fly.\"– DENIS LEARY \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVAUDEVILLE ETIQUETTE\nVaudeville Etiquette's dynamic sound pushes the boundaries of psych-folk with grit, passion, and come-hither wit. The Seattle quintet fills timeless melodies with modern lyrics, heady harmonies, and a potent country-meets-classic-rock chemistry.Their live performances are magnetic and provocative. Duo lead vocals and a wailing pedal steel dive from energetic anthems to wistful ballads and back again with psychedelia and fearless on-stage improvisation. \"Seattle music's bright new face.\" Charles Cross, The Seattle TimesOne of \"The 50 Bands Rocking Seattle Music Right Now\" - Seattle MagazineVaudeville Etiquette has been covered in USA Today, CMJ, Seattle Magazine, Relix, Yahoo! Music, American Songwriter, No Depression, Vinyl District, and more, including the Seattle Times, who called Vaudeville Etiquette “Seattle music’s bright new face” and a \"New and Noteworthy\" spotlight on iTunes.","artists":[{"id":171913,"name":"Stone

of Muscle Shoals\nOver four nights, UnderCover Presents pays tribute to two legendary artists, one landmark album, and a seminal studio band. Each unique night showcases four different Bay Area ensembles as they present bold reinterpretations of this iconic music.\n\nIn 1969, four studio musicians known affectionately as “The Swampers” opened their own studio in an old coffin factory building in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The group, formally called the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, developed their own definitive sound as a studio band for the likes of Aretha Franklin, the Staples Singers, Wilson Pickett, and many more. Pulling from the massive songbook of recordings made at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, UnderCover Presents pays tribute to the band behind the hits. The performance features a whole roster of talented Bay Area musicians, including multi-talented vocalist and beat-boxer Kid Beyond, Kendra McKinley, The Stone Foxes and Mino Yanci feat. Vadia Rhodes.","artists":[{"id":171913,"name":"Stone
