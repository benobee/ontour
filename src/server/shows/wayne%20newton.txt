His favorite instruments, 13 including banjo, guitar and piano, will be spread out on the stage. - I can play them all, - Newton says, - ...and I will be ready to play any of them. - Enveloped in the format of the show is an opportunity for audience members to ask questions of Newton while he is onstage, and audience members can conjure up questions from any angle. Musically, there is to be no fixed set list, though Newton expects to take on Danke Schoen regularly. The show will consist of music and requests, lasting approximately 80 minutes.","artists":[{"id":28457,"name":"Wayne Newton","mbid":"b6b6f1cf-e1c8-46e9-bc54-1a63ed1f8d51","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5408987.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5408987.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/WayneNewton/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":10610,"url":"WayneNewton","website":"http://www.waynenewton.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Windows at Bally's Las Vegas","place":"Windows at Bally's Las Vegas","city":"Las Vegas","region":"NV","country":"United States","latitude":36.1137645,"longitude":-115.1688991},"ontour_id":"gsfM6AdfavxChob7W","genres":["adult standards","brill building pop","cabaret","christmas","easy listening","exotica","lounge","swing","vocal jazz"]},{"id":12052486,"artist_id":28457,"artist_event_id":15041919,"title":"Wayne Newton @ Windows at Bally's Las Vegas in Las Vegas, NV","datetime":"2016-08-16T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, August 16, 2016 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Las Vegas, NV","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-05-09T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12052486?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Wayne+Newton&came_from=67","description":"50 Shades!

His favorite instruments, 13 including banjo, guitar and piano, will be spread out on the stage. I can play them all, Newton says, ... and I will be ready to play any of them. Enveloped in the format of the show is an opportunity for audience members to ask questions of Newton while he is onstage, and audience members can conjure up questions from any angle. Musically, there is to be no fixed set list, though Newton expects to take on Danke Schoen regularly. The show will consist of music and requests, lasting approximately 80 minutes.","artists":[{"id":28457,"name":"Wayne Newton","mbid":"b6b6f1cf-e1c8-46e9-bc54-1a63ed1f8d51","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5408987.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5408987.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/WayneNewton/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":10610,"url":"WayneNewton","website":"http://www.waynenewton.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Windows at Bally's Las Vegas","place":"Windows at Bally's Las Vegas","city":"Las Vegas","region":"NV","country":"United States","latitude":36.1137645,"longitude":-115.1688991},"ontour_id":"gsfM6AdfavxChob7W","genres":["adult standards","brill building pop","cabaret","christmas","easy listening","exotica","lounge","swing","vocal jazz"]},{"id":12444342,"artist_id":28457,"artist_event_id":15970928,"title":"Wayne Newton @ Windows at Bally's Las Vegas in Las Vegas, NV","datetime":"2016-09-27T21:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, September 27, 2016 at 9:30PM","formatted_location":"Las Vegas, NV","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-05-09T17:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12444342?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Wayne+Newton&came_from=67","description":"50 Shades!

He has epitomized the talent, glamour and energy that is Las Vegas. And these days, having established himself both on television and in movies as a fine actor, he's getting more attention than ever.  He does it with the incredible talent and showmanship he was born with and the approach he developed as a child entertainer in Virginia.  He simply works harder and digs deeper than anyone out there, sizing up audiences as he goes, tailoring shows to fit their moods, until he's given them their money's worth.  The songs change and the show gets re-worked, but Wayne's basic approach is the same as it has been since his beginning, and it's something that goes to the core of who he is.","artists":[{"id":28457,"name":"Wayne Newton","mbid":"b6b6f1cf-e1c8-46e9-bc54-1a63ed1f8d51","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5408987.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5408987.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/WayneNewton/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":10610,"url":"WayneNewton","website":"http://www.waynenewton.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Buffalo Run Casino","place":"Buffalo Run Casino","city":"Miami","region":"OK","country":"United States","latitude":36.8915661,"longitude":-94.8416293},"ontour_id":"gsfM6AdfavxChob7W","genres":["adult standards","brill building pop","cabaret","christmas","easy listening","exotica","lounge","swing","vocal jazz"]},{"id":12488921,"artist_id":28457,"artist_event_id":16168315,"title":"Wayne Newton @ Windows at Bally's Las Vegas in Las Vegas, NV","datetime":"2016-11-01T21:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:30PM","formatted_location":"Las Vegas, NV","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-08-22T22:19:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12488921?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Wayne+Newton&came_from=67","description":"50 Shades!

His favorite instruments, 13 including banjo, guitar and piano, will be spread out on the stage. - I can play them all, - Newton says, - ...and I will be ready to play any of them. - Enveloped in the format of the show is an opportunity for audience members to ask questions of Newton while he is onstage, and audience members can conjure up questions from any angle. Musically, there is to be no fixed set list, though Newton expects to take on Danke Schoen regularly.
