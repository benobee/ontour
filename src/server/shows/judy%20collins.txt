Collins has inspired audiences with sublime vocals, boldly vulnerable songwriting, personal life triumphs, and a firm commitment to social activism. In the 1960s, she evoked both the idealism and steely determination of a generation united against social and environmental injustices. Five decades later,  her luminescent presence shines brightly as new generations bask in the glow of her iconic 50-album body of work, and heed inspiration from her spiritual discipline to thrive in the music industry for half a century.  The award-winning singer-songwriter is esteemed for her imaginative interpretations of traditional and contemporary folk standards and her own poetically poignant original compositions. Her stunning rendition of Joni Mitchell's “Both Sides Now” from her landmark 1967 album, Wildflowers, has been entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Judy’s dreamy and sweetly intimate version of “Send in the Clowns,” a ballad written by Stephen Sondheim for the Broadway musical A Little Night Music, won \"Song of the Year” at the 1975 Grammy Awards. She’s garnered several top-ten hits gold- and platinum-selling albums. Recently, contemporary and classic artists such as Rufus Wainwright, Shawn Colvin, Arlo Gutherie, Joan Baez, and Leonard Cohen honored her legacy with the album Born to the Breed: A Tribute to Judy Collins.

Collins has inspired audiences with sublime vocals, boldly vulnerable personal life triumphs, and a firm commitment to social activism. In the 1960s, she evoked both the idealism and steely determination of a generation united against social and environmental injustices. Five decades later, her luminescent presence shines brightly as new generations bask in the glow of her iconic 50-album body of work, and heed inspiration from her spiritual discipline to thrive in the music industry for half a century.","artists":[{"id":47129,"name":"Judy

And it's even more difficult to fathom that in all that time, the two have never shared a concert stage. All that changes now, though, as Stills and Collins hit the road together for a tour, stopping at the Saban, where they'll be supporting their upcoming album, singing hits from their deep catalogs and sharing stories from the legendary Laurel Canyon music scene of the '60s and '70s.","artists":[{"id":47129,"name":"Judy

linked. First as lovers, then as pals, Collins was the inspiration for the Stills-penned, CSN-recorded “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,” which is debatably the trio’s biggest song. Thus, even though it’s years after their respective primes, it makes sense that they’d want to roll back the years. On their new covers album, the duo give in a professional effort that’s admirable at this advanced stage in their careers. A Stills/Collins album was long overdue, and if nothing else, gives them a good excuse to hit the road collectively. If nothing else, this show will provide a dose of nostalgia, along with versions of familiar songs that have you longing for those formative days on the Sunset Strip.","artists":[{"id":47129,"name":"Judy
