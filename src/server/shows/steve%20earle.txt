legendary songwriters Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, Earle quickly became a master storyteller in his own right, with his songs being recorded by Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Waylon Jennings, Travis Tritt, The Pretenders, Joan Baez and countless others. 1986 saw the release of his debut record, Guitar Town, which shot to number one on the country charts and immediately established the term “New Country.” What followed was an extremely exciting and varied array of releases including the biting hard rock of Copperhead Road (1988), the minimalist beauty of Train A Comin’ (1995), the politically charged masterpiece, Jerusalem (2002) and the Grammy Award Winning albums The Revolution Starts…Now (2004), Washington Square Serenade (2007) and Townes (2009). I’ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive (2011) is Steve Earle’s 14th Studio Album and shares the same name with his 2011 debut novel. Of the novel, Patti Smith stated, “Steve Earle brings to his prose the same authenticity, poetic spirit and cinematic energy he projects in his music. I’ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive is like a dream you can’t shake, offering beauty and remorse, redemption in spades.”\n\nwww.steveearle.com\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AINUPFbFpqg\n\nThe Orange

December 5th 2016 Steve Earle and The Dukes are hosting the 2nd annual benefit concert to help raise important funds for children diagnosed with Autism. This will be the only show in New York City in which Steve Earle and The Dukes will be performing his debut album Guitar Town which came out in 1985 in its entirety. Joined by Graham Nash and Shawn Colvin this evening of amazing music is sure to be a memorable one. All net proceeds raised by ticket sales will be donated to The Keswell School formerly known as The McCarton School an educational program for children and young adults with Autism.
