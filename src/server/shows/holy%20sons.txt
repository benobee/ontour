(Seattle, Southern Lord) \nHOLY SONS (Brooklyn, ft. Emil of Om/Grails) \n8PM Doors // 9PM Sounds | $13 in Advance // $15 Day of Show | 18+ \nEARTH was formed in Olympia, Wa in 1989 by Dylan Carlson, with an ever evolving line up including Slim Moon (Kill Rock Stars founder), Joe Preston (Melvins) and many others. After moving to Seattle and signing to Sub Pop in 1990, they would release 3 full lengths and an EP including Earth 2. Considered by many a definitive statement of the drone triumphant, others have described it as “the inevitable result of the damage done by downers to perception of time”. Whichever the case, its influence is undeniable. If it wasnt for this album, bands like Sunn 0))) simply would not exist. In 1996 they recorded their final Sub Pop lp Pentastar (In The Style of Demons) in an abandoned Colt 45 factory. After its release the “group” disbanded and Earth/Dylan Carlson go on hiatus. 6 years later Earth becomes active once more, with the addition of Adrienne Davies on drums. Unveiling it’s new cleaner, sparser, and more improvisational style. In September 2005 Earth release their first studio album in 9 years, diversifying their sound and pushing all perceived boundaries. With Hex; or Printing in the Infernal Method, Earth create an intense, powerful album that defies restrictions of genre. The monolithic darkness of previous releases such as Earth 2 is still apparent, though now shifted away from saturated and distorted guitar tones. Using compression, echo, tremelo, and reverb, it is a specifically American style. A “Black Americana” reminiscent of an immense desert landscape at dusk. It is a sound that draws on the influence of Duane Eddy, Merle Haggard & Roy Buchanan and fuses it with the vibe of epic visionary composer Ennio Morricone. Beautifully darkened, huge chords that resonate slowly while every single note is played with a precise conviction. \nWhere Hex reveled in dark satanic twang and austere american beauty, 2008’s The Bees Made Honey In The Lion’s Skull finds Dylan Carlson and the band growing into a harder, more rock, American Gospel and impovisitory direction framed by truly psychedelic production and blazing guitar sounds. Earth shows it’s affinity to the more adventurous San Francisco bands of the late 60’s and 70’s, and the more spiritually aware and exciting forms of Jazz-Rock from the same era.The most recent records Angels Of Darkness, Demons of Light - parts 1& 2 (2010 and 2011 respectively) serve as testament to the fact that they have come a long way since 1989. Drawing on inspiration from both British Folk-Rock bands Pentangle and Fairport Convention and the North African Tuareg band Tinariwen, the new material, while still “heavy” is much more fluid and melodically oriented, more textured and nuanced. It contains greater improvisatory interplay between the musicians. \nOn one hand they acknowledge previous recordings, cultivating the jazz infused Americana presented on The Bees Made Honey In The Lion’s Skull and on the other, there are significant changes which give birth to yet another new sound. The addition of cello, though subtle at times, adds a more haunting tone to the repetition throughout. Though such repetition may, at times, seem simplistic, there is absolutely nothing simple about holding a note as long as Earth do. \n“The ongoing musical project which is Earth has always been concerned with repetition and the drone or THE NOTE. When I was younger and full of hubris I believed that a “pure” or “original” music could be developed in a static and removed state from other music. I now realize that music, especially music containing the drone or THE NOTE, and music that effects a spiritual reaction from the listener is a continuum. It is a music that has continued throughout time and manifested itself in a number of different forms or “genres” or\"styles”. I began to see my music as part of and a product of that continuum. I also began to see that continuum strongly expressed in historically ‘american’ forms. Specifically the “genres” of “country” and “blues”. The truly ‘cosmic american musics’.” Dylan Carlson summer 2005.","artists":[{"id":114394,"name":"Holy

fait leurs classes dans les meilleures formations rock psyché de la côte ouest étasunienne. <BR>\nUne première tournée européenne couronnée de succès en 2013 se terminant en fanfare par une performance remarquable (et remarquée) au ROADBURN festival et revoilà la nouvelle coqueluche de THRILL JOCKEY en Europe pour présenter son nouvel album, Berkana, enregistrée au Tim Greens Louder Studios (Melvins, Sleepy Sun, Wolves in the Throne Room). <BR> <BR>\n\nDuo gagnant en cette froide soirée dhiver lausannoise avec un second groupe au programme de la soirée. <BR>\nHOLY SONS, également signé sur THRILL JOCKEY, cest le projet d'Emil Amos, multi-instrumentiste et membre de OM, GRAILS et LILACS & CHAMPAGNE.  <BR>\nFrissons et envolées \"folk avant-garde\" seront de la partie avec une vértitable pépite que certains ont pu voir en live en ouverture de formations comme EARTH, SLEEP ou THE MOUNTAIN GOATS.  <BR>\nLa nouvelle galette de Amos, parue cette année et joyeusement intitulé \"Fall of Man, a été produite par Brandon Eggleston (Mountain Goats, Swans), Al Carlson (Oneohtrix Point Never) et Jeff Saltzman (Grails). <BR>\nA noter également lexcellente vidéo de

SALE FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24 AT 10AM\r\nMONO w/ Holy SonsFriday, April 28Doors at 7pm / Show at 8pm$16/$14 for membersAll ages / Standing\r\n\r\nThe Tokyo, Japan based 4 piece Instrumental Rock band MONO was originally formed in 1999. Their unique approach of blending orchestral arrangements and shoegaze guitar noise in their music has been held in extremely high regard; so much so, that the band’s musicianship can no longer be sustained by Rock music alone and was praised by British Musical Magazine NME as “This is music for the Gods”. One of the most monumental live memories of the band was a special set of shows with 23-piece orchestra in New York, Tokyo, London and Melbourne.  Their annual world tour consists of around 150 shows. The band has now visited over 50 countries and proudly holds the stake of being one of the most internationally successful bands in Japan. Among their fans, they are revered as one of the best live bands in Rock.  After releasing 9 successful albums including a live album with New York orchestra, the band received the highly regarded award “The Marshall Hawkins Awards: Best Musical Score - Featurette” from the Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema for their collaborative short film “Where We Begin” in 2015.  Now in 2016, the band has finished recording their 9th album with Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago. The album is set for an Autumn 2016 release.","artists":[{"id":114394,"name":"Holy

Tokyo, Japan based 4 piece Instrumental Rock band MONO was originally formed in 1999. Their unique approach of blending orchestral arrangements and shoegaze guitar noise in their music has been held in extremely high regard; so much so, that the band's musicianship can no longer be sustained by Rock music alone and was praised by British Musical Magazine NME as \"This is music for the Gods\". One of the most monumental live memories of the band was a special set of shows with 23-piece orchestra in New York, Tokyo, London and Melbourne.\n\nTheir annual world tour consists of around 150 shows. The band has now visited over 55 countries and proudly holds the stake of being one of the most internationally successful bands in Japan. Among their fans, they are revered as one of the best live bands in Rock.\n\nAfter releasing 10 successful albums including a live album with New York orchestra, the band received the highly regarded award \"The Marshall Hawkins Awards: Best Musical Score - Featurette\" from the Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema for their collaborative short film \"Where We Begin\" in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the band recorded their 9th album \"Requiem For Hell\" with Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago and was released worldwide on Oct 14, 2016.","artists":[{"id":114394,"name":"Holy Sons","mbid":"5a268534-c051-4148-ac53-380f805c5f72","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5321497.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5321497.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HolySons/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":3226,"url":"HolySons","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Walter's Downtown","place":"Walter's Downtown","city":"Houston","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":29.769817,"longitude":-95.357451},"ontour_id":"AgaWQJzvnWyRiuTRe","genres":["freak folk"]},{"id":13997948,"artist_id":114394,"artist_event_id":17730740,"title":"Holy Sons @ Club Dada in Dallas, TX","datetime":"2017-05-13T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Dallas, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-02-24T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13997948?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Holy+Sons&came_from=67","description":"Mono","artists":[{"id":114394,"name":"Holy Sons","mbid":"5a268534-c051-4148-ac53-380f805c5f72","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5321497.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5321497.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HolySons/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":3226,"url":"HolySons","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Club Dada","place":"Club Dada","city":"Dallas","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":32.78458,"longitude":-96.784096},"ontour_id":"AgaWQJzvnWyRiuTRe","genres":["freak folk"]},{"id":13997954,"artist_id":114394,"artist_event_id":18554627,"title":"Holy Sons @ Barracuda in Austin, TX","datetime":"2017-05-14T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Austin, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13997954?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Holy+Sons&came_from=67","description":"Margin Walker presents\nMono\nw/ Holy Sons\nDoors: 8PM\nALL AGES\nTICKET INFORMATION\n\nOnce you purchase, you will receive an order confirmation email from Eventbrite on behalf of Margin Walker.

What began as a solo project by John Darnielle has since developed into a celebrated four-piece with a cult-like fan base. With Darnielle at the helm, The Mountain Goats craft honest short stories atop folk music. Laden with dark lyricism, Darnielle’s music often beguiles listeners with melodic guitar riffs and catchy choruses, but these songs are chock-full of serious material — from abusive stepfathers to failed marriages. On tour in support of their 16th studio album, Goths, The Mountain Goats will visit Houston just eight days after its release. Given Darnielle’s enthusiastic fan base, many attendees will probably already be singing along to all the new songs.                    \n        \n                \n            Promotional Event Description\n            The Mountain Goats @ WOMH\n            Don't miss The Mountain Goats w/ Holy Sons Downstairs at White Oak Music Hall on Saturday May 27th.
