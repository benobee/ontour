music legend, Merle Haggard, known as “the poet of the common man” for his powerful lyrics drawn from his life experiences, is still going strong 50 years after the release of his first album. After doing time in San Quentin at the age of 20, Haggard embraced the voice of hard times and helped create the newly emerging “Bakersfield Sound.” It was a grittier, rougher sound for country music at the time but he proved himself with heartfelt lyrics specializing in sorrow with a dash of humor and hope. His first single made it into the top twenty and there was no slowing down after that as Haggard produced a steady line of number one hits including, “The Fugitive,” “Branded Man,” “Workin’ Man’s Blues,” “Hungry Eyes,” “Big City,” “Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star” and his most popular song, “Okie From Muskogee.” Merle Haggard is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, a Grammy Award winner, a Kennedy Center Honoree and at this year’s Academy of Country Music Awards on April 6, he will be presented with the Crystal Milestone Award celebrating his 50th year in the country music industry.","artists":[{"id":45816,"name":"Merle
