off the stomping, hairy heels of Ash's GARGANTUA album release and tour with Scott and Andy from The Living End, Ash is returning to the pavement as the lone troubadour, to pound his way up and down the West coast. Renowned for the most incredibly, thumping live shows to come out of single human being, Ash is super excited about being back on the stomp box and reaffirming his decade long reputation as being the loudest one-man-band around.\r\n\r\nDuring Ash's time with Scott and Andy - one of the country's most skilled rhythm sections, he was forced to step things up and do something he'd never done before - practice! The excitement of the challenge - the fear almost of playing with two such musical entities - spawned in Ash a passion for musical self-betterment he hadn't felt since that all consuming, all too common teenage obsession of wanting to become the greatest musician in the world. Whilst Ash holds no ambition so high and haughty these days, his focus now is to experiment with things he previously may have shrugged off as being too hard - the result: a braver, bolder, more bombastic Ash Grunwald than ever before....who also now plays the mouth harp....\r\n\r\nThe first state to get a gander at this pumped up, super buzzing Mr G is Western Australia - nabbing 5 shows this coming February.","artists":[{"id":39785,"name":"Ash Grunwald","mbid":"33c460bf-6482-4b75-b652-356da4b0b308","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8475114.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8475114.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AshGrunwald/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/AshGrunwald","tracker_count":21688,"url":"AshGrunwald","website":"http://www.ashgrunwald.com"},{"id":9195408,"name":"Benjalu (Solo) ","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Benjalu%28solo%29/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"Benjalu(solo)","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Settlers Tavern ","place":"Settlers Tavern ","city":"Margaret River","region":"WA","country":"Australia","latitude":-33.949821,"longitude":115.073638},"ontour_id":"cfEfRXv3yuFvjfWDR","genres":[]},{"id":6418047,"artist_id":39785,"artist_event_id":6603433,"title":"Ash Grunwald @ Catlins River Festival  in Owaka, New Zealand","datetime":"2013-03-31T12:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, March 31, 2013 at 12:00PM","formatted_location":"Owaka, New Zealand","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2013-03-27T01:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/6418047?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Ash+Grunwald&came_from=67","description":"Catlins River Festival is a coming-together of great people, great music and great vibes, in the most epic of locations.

Multi-award winning songwriter Ash Grunwald will be bringing his stunning fusion of “Blues and Beatz” back to the UK from his native Australia. Ash last performed in the UK back in 2011 and has established an awesome reputation for his live performances having played the cream of the South West's festivals such as Ocean Fest in Devon, Surf Relief at Watergate Bay, Boardmasters in Newquay and Beach Break Live in Wales. He has since been playing festivals all over Australia, Canada and Japan. \r\n\r\nAsh is a passionate surfer and is back in the UK to promote his sixth studio album \"Troubles Door \"\r\n\r\nAlong side Ash is Newquay based singer songwriter..and surfer, Ruarri Joseph. Ruarri has received high critical acclaim for his songwriting and the video for the single \"Till the luck runs dry\" has just hit 100,000 views. His 4th album \"Brother\" is to be released this spring and he has recently been signed up by global music giant Warner to promote the new album, which is set to be his most successful yet.  \r\n\r\nLast but not least, we will be introducing the fantastically talented Miss Polly Money. Polly is only 17 years old but has already been receiving accolades far and wide for her songwriting skills. Under the title “ Polly Money -The Next Big Thing”, Acoustic Magazine recently wrote -\r\n\r\n\"Hailing from Falmouth, Cornwall, and at only 17-years-old, Polly Money is writing music and singing songs that are making the acoustic community sit up and take notice. 2013 is the year for Polly Money\".\r\n\r\nShe is not to be missed.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Level Tour is a great evening out to enjoy outstanding live performances, from an incredible line up of artistes, at amazing venues.

Attendance was around the 300 mark and bands from all over the region and from as far away as Smithers and Calgary were present. Our headliners included the Juno -award winner,\" Youssou Seck\"accompanied by Latin guitar maestro: \"Manuel Jara\" and percussionist extraordinaire: \"Brent Van dusin\".\r\n\r\nThe Festival was a whopping success having been thrown together by a very small group of committed volunteers in just 5 weeks!\r\n\r\nThe Robson Valley Music Festival is held on the land of Touring and recording artists:\"Mamaguroove\" in particular, Seth and Shara's place. LA few years ago, with the help of a few friends and Seth's dad, Dave, these crazy cats decided to turn what was supposed to be a small gathering of family and friends into a full fledged festival! They (We) ran all details themselves on a non-existent budget, counting on ticket sales at the gate to pull them through! Everything from stage sound and lighting to security to Shara's amazing cuisine at The Performer's Hospitality Kitchen was provided by the family with help from a handful of travelers and close friends. Bands all agreed to donate their performance services in exchange for unequaled hospitality and good times! We even had a samba drumming and dancing workshop for the kids! The result, albeit exhausting to the organizers, was an intimate close gathering celebrating incredible local, regional and international talent and linking our remote, rural community to the wider world of performance art.\r\n\r\nAfter all was said and done, we knew we had to keep going, there was a spirit of fellowship and excitement in the community which had been missing for a long time. This year with the creation of \"The Robson Valley Music Society\", we are moving full steam ahead to create a bigger and better Festival while still holding onto the intimate feel and exotic setting which so many city Festivals lack! In the spirit of other great northern Festivals such as \"The Kispiox Music Festival\", \"The Midsummer Music Festival\", and \"Edge of the World\" to name a few, we are striving to offer attendees from near and far one of the most incredibly powerful presentations of live entertainment, in one of the most pristine environments in the west! Don't miss your chance to become part of the birth of a legend! Explore the rest of the site and buy your tickets soon, while supplies last! Attendance is limited to 1000 people.

John Butler Trio and The Cat Empire this year showed their huge confidence in the festival, which has now rightly taken its place in the nation’s major music festival program,” he said.\r\n\r\n“We now have a strong overseas connection, particularly with New Orleans, emphasised at this year’s festival with Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue, and Galactic.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure we’ll be seeing more class acts on stage in 2013.”\r\n\r\nDivisional councillor Tim Dwyer said the Caloundra community had embraced the festival as its own.\r\n\r\n“Caloundra was teeming with visitors at this year’s festival and it was showcased to the world as a friendly, relaxed place to enjoy the best of today’s popular music,” he said.\r\n\r\n“We got the Fringe Festival off to a great start, too, and it will go from strength to strength each year from here as the community event surrounding the Music Festival.\r\n\r\n“The business community got right behind both events this year and they have seen the returns from doing so.”\r\n\r\nFestival director Richie Eyles said it was too early yet to indicate who might feature on the 2013 “but it will be a great line-up again”.\r\n\r\n“Everyone who came to play at this year’s festival had a great time and we are well-regarded on the festival circuit,” he said.\r\n\r\nMr Eyles said the 2012 Fringe and Music festival also created income for community groups.\r\n\r\n“Caloundra State School P&C made $10,000 from its provision of camping sites at the school, while water refill supplier Reef Check made more than $3000 during the three-day Music Festival keeping everyone well-hydrated while minimising the use of plastic bottles.” \r\n","artists":[{"id":39785,"name":"Ash Grunwald","mbid":"33c460bf-6482-4b75-b652-356da4b0b308","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8475114.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8475114.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AshGrunwald/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/AshGrunwald","tracker_count":21688,"url":"AshGrunwald","website":"http://www.ashgrunwald.com"},{"id":2240,"name":"Xavier Rudd","mbid":"6689a626-4de7-41d5-9ec3-5a289472a9e2","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/XavierRudd/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/XavierRuddOfficial","tracker_count":183327,"url":"XavierRudd","website":"http://www.xavierrudd.com"},{"id":334441,"name":"Boy & Bear","mbid":"fff936ee-8dbf-4202-9647-410c6b1924a7","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BoyAndBear/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/boyandbear/","tracker_count":158118,"url":"BoyAndBear","website":""},{"id":13031,"name":"Blue King Brown","mbid":"1b067ec6-d3c7-4c7e-bf05-297c4eb03416","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BlueKingBrown/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/bluekingbrown","tracker_count":16240,"url":"BlueKingBrown","website":"http://bluekingbrown.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Caloundra Music Festival ","place":"Caloundra Festival ","city":"Caloundra","region":"04","country":"Australia","latitude":-26.8,"longitude":153.1333333},"ontour_id":"cfEfRXv3yuFvjfWDR","genres":[]},{"id":6946094,"artist_id":39785,"artist_event_id":7416322,"title":"Ash Grunwald @ Whitsunday Calling in Airlie Beach Qld, Australia","datetime":"2013-10-05T12:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 5, 2013 at 12:00PM","formatted_location":"Airlie Beach Qld, Australia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2013-07-02T01:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/6946094?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Ash+Grunwald&came_from=67","description":"Katchafire + Daryl Braithwaite + Gangagang + The Radiators + many more!

We're thrilled to be home and very excited about reconnecting with all our supporters and friends as we move forward reigniting the tradition that made the Great Southern, or Narooma, as it was affectionately known, so admired.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm shown by thousands of supporters during our hiatus has been very humbling and it's our promise to repay their faith and to deliver a truly memorable festival in 2013.\r\n\r\nMuch work has been done behind the scenes to enable the homecoming with plenty more to be done before we welcome you back this October.\r\n\r\nNarooma was by no means the biggest Blues Festival in Australia, but we always delivered a stellar line up of International and National artists in one of Australia's most magnificent coastal villages.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by pristine water, beautiful beaches and National Parks, Narooma provides the perfect backdrop for the Great Southern Blues Festival. Our intimate, multi stage site in the middle of beautiful Narooma on the NSW South Coast within easy walking distance of most accommodation is in itself something special.\r\n\r\nAs we head towards October, we are building what we believe will be one of the best Festival line ups in Australia this year for those who love predominately 'Blues' music but also dig a little more obscure music.\r\n\r\n2013 will see the return of some of your favorite artists along with the customary special and exclusive acts that we became renowned for over the years. Keep visiting our website for updates.\r\n\r\nWe value your feedback and encourage you to make your thoughts and opinions known to us. Whether you have a comment about what artists you would like to see or perhaps suggest some improvement to out facilities, all comments are most welcome. Click here to send feedback.\r\n\r\nAs with previous years Mojos Camping Village will adjoin the Festival site and again we will beam the NRL Grand Final into the Festival.\r\n\r\nIf you were a regular Narooma attendee or are contemplating coming to Narooma for the first time this year, we encourage you to book early as we have a 'Strictly Limited Capacity' as part of approval conditions. Our 'First Up' tickets will go sale to our Narooma Members on Monday, April 15th.\r\n\r\nHere at HQ, we look forward to catching up with all our friends and welcoming new folk to the Friendly Festival.\r\n\r\nCheers for now – Team Narooma.","artists":[{"id":39785,"name":"Ash Grunwald","mbid":"33c460bf-6482-4b75-b652-356da4b0b308","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8475114.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8475114.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AshGrunwald/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/AshGrunwald","tracker_count":21688,"url":"AshGrunwald","website":"http://www.ashgrunwald.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Great Southern Blues Festival","place":"Great Southern Blues Festival ","city":"Beauty Point","region":"02","country":"Australia","latitude":-36.218842,"longitude":150.132324},"ontour_id":"cfEfRXv3yuFvjfWDR","genres":[]},{"id":6946102,"artist_id":39785,"artist_event_id":7416333,"title":"Ash Grunwald @ Sydney Blues & Roots Festival  in Windsor, Canada","datetime":"2013-10-26T12:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 26, 2013 at 12:00PM","formatted_location":"Windsor, Canada","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2013-07-01T01:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/6946102?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Ash+Grunwald&came_from=67","description":"Sydney Blues & Roots Festival 2013\r\nThe Ride Continues.....\r\nThe 5th annual Sydney Blues & Roots Festival\r\n24th to 27th October 2013\r\nAustralia's newest and fastest growing music festival.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe promoters of the Sydney Blues & Roots Festival proudly announce the the first of our confirmed artists\r\n\r\nfor this years Sydney Blues & Roots Festival.

The Gold Coast's original and very first all-­‐in-­‐one, full day, island rock show & party cruise. If you like the sounds of what Yum Yum Popsicle are all about then this is one big event where you do not want to miss the boat, literally.\r\n\r\nSet sail from Mariners Cove Main Beach, on course to `rock’ at the secluded South Stradbroke Island destination, and with only a limited number of 1000 scallywags to join our crew, 'The Other Side' is going to sell out fast. The Gold Coast's very first and original ‘Full Day lsland Rock Show and Boat Party’ featuring ASH GRUNWALD the internationally recognised, soul singing, foot stomping, bluesy beat jammer who’s renowned for his raging live shows. The screeching vocals, electrifying riffs, keys and driving beats from the sisters STONEFIELD (triplejunearthed.com) will be rocking out with support from the coast’s own young local up comers; the scotch drinking, crowd surfing, stage smashing, super rockers THE VERNONS.\r\n\r\nSuper sized luxury Catamarans depart from Mariners Cove in Main Beach. They will ferry the Othersiders to and from the secluded island location in about sixty minutes each way. Plenty of beverages will be flowing as some of the coast’s top DJ’s get you in the mood for a little wiggle on the boats dance floor. Ride the tide to very special kind of island seclusion, set amongst the untouched local flora and fauna, back-­‐dropped by the hinterland silhouette greeting the ocean’s edge, which is glazed by the noon sun. Feel the hot sand between the toes, take a dip or grab another refreshing beverage before you and 999 other rockers make the island shake for over five hours.\r\n\r\n18+ Valid Photo ID Required *

of live music, rolling waves, shimmering sand and sizzling sunshine.\r\n\r\n2.00pm Robbie Miller\r\n3.00pm GOVS\r\n4.00pm MTNS\r\n5.00pm Ash Grunwald\r\n\r\nBleach* Festival pays a visit to Burleigh Beach.\r\n\r\nImagine this.\r\n\r\nYou’re nestled on a picnic rug, looking at the surf with the sand between your toes and a spectacular backdrop of ocean-rimmed Gold Coast skyline. Your family’s there, your partner, or maybe it’s a group of your besties. What more could Bleach* do to complete the picture? Throw in a line-up of some of Australia’s best rock artists and bands and the scene is set! Bleach* at Burleigh is back in 2014.\r\n\r\nHeadline act Ash Grunwald is a performer who epitomises the Bleach* ‘story’. This popular bluesman has two great passions - music and surfing – and will be revelling in his perfect environment.\r\n\r\nAlso on the bill for Bleach* Burleigh is MTNS. They may be newcomers to the music scene but this band has hit the ground running with their debut single Lost Track of Time striking a chord with Aussie music fans.\r\n\r\nGOVS is arguably the hottest new band coming out of the Gold Coast, with Richard Kingsmill from Triple J describing their tunes as having enormous potential. This indie band is gaining a reputation for generating ‘gorgeous low-fi, dream pop’.\r\n\r\nUnearthed by Tripe J in 2013, Robbie Miller is a young Brisbane indigenous artist who has a unique and cruisey, highly sought after solo sound. Robbie is ready to share his passion for music with Bleach*.\r\n","artists":[{"id":39785,"name":"Ash

first ever Sea N Sound Festival will take place in the carpark of The Wharf Tavern and Underwater World in Mooloolaba on June 11 and feature well-loved Australian artist Pete Murray.\n\nThe event, a snapshot of the unique coastal lifestyle of the area, will focus on live original music, local seafood and Australian craft beer to bring a truly 'Australian' event to the Sunshine Coast, bringing together all things that make Mooloolaba such an amazing place. Rows of local fresh seafood vendors will be set up along with the showcase of 10 craft brewers on site with taste tests and food/drink available for purchase.\nThe inaugural festival is positioned on the Mooloolah river, opposite the stunning Mooloolaba beach and will be converted to hold 2000 people with construction of a large outdoor stage to host well known Aussie performer Ash Grunwald alongside Pete Murray and band. An under-card of soon to be announced local original talent will also fill out the day.\nEarlybird Tickets on sale 24 March for only $35 (limited release until 1st April)  \nGates: 12pm  \n\nRead more

Newtz also wanted to use the event to raise funds to go towards the development of a project that will encourage Victorian emergency services employees to reach out for help.\n\nSadly, Newtz passed away in a tragic accident while holidaying in Bali. A small committee of his fellow firefighting mates stepped up to fulfil Newtz’s dream and we are pleased to announce the Let Me Know Suicide Prevention Fundraiser event will be held on Saturday 19 November 2016.\n\nThe fundraising event will include a variety of entertainment that will both entertain and move and inspire attendees! The entertainment line-up includes head lining act, Ash Grunwald and supporting acts DJ Aybner, Nathan Kaye, Lost Amigos, DJ Mermaid, and Chris Russells Chicken Walk. Allan Sparkes CV, former NSW Police Officer, will also share his experience battling PTSD and depression. \n\nA charity auction will be held on the night, with auction item details to be released closer to the date.\n\nThe Let Me Know team hope to raise $50,000 through ticket sales, sponsorship, donations, and the charity auction. Funds will go towards the development of an App that will give firefighters in Victoria access to help anywhere, anytime when experiencing mental stress, PTSD, depression and anxiety.\n\nTickets are now on sale for $45.00 and can only be purchase online (no tickets will be sold at the door). Purchase your tickets today so you don’t miss out!\n\nDate: Saturday 19 November 2016\n\nVenue: Max Watt’s 125 Swanston St, Melbourne\n\nDoors open: 7.00pm\n\nTo find out more about this event, or become a sponsor, please contact LFF Nathaniel O’Brien (currently on secondment with CFA) via N.OBrien@cfa.vic.gov.au or Carlie Newman via cnewman@mfb.vic.gov.au\n\nThis event is supported by MFB,
