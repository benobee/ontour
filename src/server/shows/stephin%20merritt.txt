               \n                    Lindsey Rhoades                \n            \n                                    Aging gracefully can be tough, especially in an industry obsessed with youth. Leave it to Stephin Merritt, founder of baroque-pop legends the Magnetic Fields, to reach his fifties with idiosyncratic aplomb. Taking a cue from the conceptual impulse that made sprawling albums like 69 Love Songs so endearing and cohesive, Merritt will present the Magnetic Fields' newest record, 50 Song Memoir, over two nights at BAM, with unique setlists each evening. The LP, which won't be out until early 2017, features one autobiographical track for each year of Merritt's life, delivered with his characteristic wit and unmistakable baritone. The multi-instrumentalist has recruited seven musicians to interpret the work live, performing against a backdrop of custom set pieces that correspond to Merritt's fanciful narrative. Were he not a master of mirthful self-flagellation, Merritt might be branded a narcissist; instead, we'll raise a glass and toast another year for the patron saint of self-deprecating songwriting.","artists":[{"id":73848,"name":"Stephin Merritt","mbid":"fec52bf2-450e-4ca7-a517-c3f2097d964c","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/3719168.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/3719168.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/StephinMerritt/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":3756,"url":"StephinMerritt","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Howard Gilman Opera House","place":"Howard Gilman Opera House","city":"Brooklyn","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.6864433,"longitude":-73.9777145},"ontour_id":"kWwaifG2uA9MXoEpP","genres":["anti-folk","chamber pop","e6fi","lo-fi","twee pop"]},{"id":12750313,"artist_id":73848,"artist_event_id":15981394,"title":"Stephin Merritt @ Howard Gilman Opera House in Brooklyn, NY","datetime":"2016-12-03T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Brooklyn, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12750313?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Stephin+Merritt&came_from=67","description":"By\n                \n                    Lindsey Rhoades                \n            \n                                    Aging gracefully can be tough, especially in an industry obsessed with youth.
