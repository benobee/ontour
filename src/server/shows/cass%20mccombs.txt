7:30 / Show 8\r\nOver the past decade, Cass McCombs has established himself as one of our premier songwriters. It’s a career that has twisted and turned, from style to subject, both between records and within them. Diverse, cryptic, vital and refreshingly rebellious — just when you think you have him pinned down, you find you’re on the wrong track.\r\nHowever, Mangy Love, his Anti Records debut, is McCombs at his most blunt: tackling sociopolitical issues through his uniquely cracked lens of lyrical wit and singular insight.\r\nMcCombs uses himself as a mirror to misguided and confounding realities, confronting them head-on: “Rancid Girl” reads like a ZZ Top study in Kardashian politics, “Run Sister Run” a mantra for a misogynistic justice system, “Bum Bum Bum” displays a racist, elitist government through the allegory of sadistic dog breeding; the album is sewn together by a common thread of ‘opposition,’ most directly articulated in “Opposite House”, with allusions to mental illness. ‘Laughter Is The Best Medicine’ provides a possible recipe for healing, with the help of an authentic medicine man, the legendary Rev. Goat Carson. The severity of his lyrics is contrasted by the music, which ventures into groovy realms of Philly soul, NorCal psychedelia and New York paranoia punk, articulating the spontaneity and joy of his live show better than ever before.\r\nThe record is unquestionably a work of great studio aptitude: a carefully arranged, high-fidelity production by veteran Rob Schnapf and Dan Horne. And as usual, McCombs is joined by many notable members of his eclectic musical tribe, whose names are proudly displayed on the back cover.\r\nMostly written during a bitter New York City winter and while traveling in Ireland, Mangy Love is Cass at the top of his game, reaching new sonic heights, creatively evolving lyrically, and resulting in his most provocative and complete record yet.\r\n \r\nTICKET INFORMATION  • Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue. • No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

once-in-a-generation talent will be in Houston on Tuesday, but it’s not Kanye West. It’s tough to overstate how hard critics have fallen for Cass McCombs’s eighth album, Mangy Love; his clippings are full of words and phrases like “master,” “compelling” and “the height of his talents.” Following up his Americana-tinged 2013 double album Big Wheel and Others, McCombs trains his preternatural intelligence on the gory details of our dysfunctional society; the image-ridden lyrics of “Rancid Girl” or “Medusa’s Outhouse,” to name two, sound straight out of a dream you’d really rather not remember. The kicker is how McCombs pairs these waking nightmares with music so placid it’s almost impossible not to be lulled along, a juxtaposition not unlike Steely Dan in its sinister genius. Whether McCombs is a seedy poet or mad prophet, or perhaps a little of both, there’s definitely nobody out there making music quite like him.","artists":[{"id":24762,"name":"Cass

POP\n\nCass McCombs Band (ANTI / USA) :  En marge sans être outsider, Cass McCombs compose des chansons empreintes de nostalgie, à l’écriture en dehors des modes et des standards. Il synthétise une écriture à la fois blues country soft et une indie folk\npop léchée à sauce américaine. Plus proches des racines de l'americana que de la flower narcotic pop californienne des 70's où il réside, c'est d'ailleurs sur la East Coast (New York, Baltimore) que le projet de groupe a pris sa réalité. Tout dans Cass McCombs repose sur l'écriture d'une chanson, un texte, un thème, une mélodie. Cette versatilité lui a permis de se retrouver à partager la scène de projets très différents (Ariel Pink, Blonde Redhead, Oxes ou Arcade Fire pour n'en citer que quelques uns). L'autre aspect central de la personnalité de Cass c'est son nomadisme permanent que ce soit pour du tour ou pour vivre ici ou là. Un personnage précieux, une musique inoxydable, un univers complexe qui montre toute ses latitudes sur scène. Ce double album fait suite à une série d'albums cultes: Dropping The Writ, Catacombs, Wit's End et Humor Risk et prouve une nouvelle fois le génie visionnaire de l'un des plus grands songwriters de sa génération. Un artiste radical, sans concession, authentiquement situé du côté de la contre culture. Composé de 22 chansons, Big Wheel and Others est sans doute son album le plus ambitueux et le plus varié; Un condensé de plus de 10 ans de création et de chaos dans la vie d'un pilier de l'underground américain.","artists":[{"id":24762,"name":"Cass
