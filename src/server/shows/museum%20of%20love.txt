Bowl their thing, playing six year-end shows there last year, with special guests like Sharon Van Etten, Vanessa Carlton, Jana Hunter of Lower Dens, Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus, and none other than Stevie Fucking Nicks. For that run, John McCauley and crew played entire albums from Elvis Costello, NRBQ, Lou Reed, Devo, and even the Beatles. While there will no doubt be covers and special guests galore, this time around they're cramming it all into two nights, on December 30 and New Year's Eve, with Last Good Tooth opening both shows. The New Year's Eve gig costs an extra $20, and DFA supergroup Museum of Love DJs the afterparty after the ball drops.","artists":[{"id":7693300,"name":"Museum of Love","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6084870.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6084870.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MuseumOfLove/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4176,"url":"MuseumOfLove","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Bowl","place":"Brooklyn Bowl","city":"Brooklyn","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.721876,"longitude":-73.957676},"ontour_id":"5nrhKBZ5eeFhE2kcu","genres":["etherpop","gauze pop"]},{"id":11712261,"artist_id":7693300,"artist_event_id":14576847,"title":"Museum of Love @ Bang Bang in San Diego, CA","datetime":"2016-04-16T22:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, April 16, 2016 at 10:00PM","formatted_location":"San Diego, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-03-21T14:25:53","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11712261?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Museum+of+Love&came_from=67","description":"MUSEUM OF LOVE","artists":[{"id":7693300,"name":"Museum of Love","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6084870.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6084870.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MuseumOfLove/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4176,"url":"MuseumOfLove","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Bang Bang","place":"Bang Bang","city":"San Diego","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":32.7117386,"longitude":-117.1595078},"ontour_id":"5nrhKBZ5eeFhE2kcu","genres":["etherpop","gauze pop"]},{"id":11312593,"artist_id":7693300,"artist_event_id":14029821,"title":"Museum of Love @ The Echo in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2016-04-19T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, April 19, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-01-29T12:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11312593?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Museum+of+Love&came_from=67","description":"Museum of Love","artists":[{"id":7693300,"name":"Museum of Love","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6084870.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6084870.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MuseumOfLove/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4176,"url":"MuseumOfLove","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"The Echo","place":"The Echo","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.077745,"longitude":-118.259655},"ontour_id":"5nrhKBZ5eeFhE2kcu","genres":["etherpop","gauze pop"]},{"id":11315020,"artist_id":7693300,"artist_event_id":14033886,"title":"Museum of Love @ Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2016-04-20T21:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, April 20, 2016 at 9:00PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-02-05T12:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11315020?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Museum+of+Love&came_from=67","description":"Miike Snow","artists":[{"id":7693300,"name":"Museum of Love","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6084870.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6084870.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MuseumOfLove/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4176,"url":"MuseumOfLove","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Fonda Theatre","place":"Fonda Theatre","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.101538,"longitude":-118.323259},"ontour_id":"5nrhKBZ5eeFhE2kcu","genres":["etherpop","gauze pop"]},{"id":12265938,"artist_id":7693300,"artist_event_id":15508584,"title":"Museum of Love @ Fox Theatre & Cafe in Boulder, CO","datetime":"2016-08-01T20:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:30PM","formatted_location":"Boulder, CO","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12265938?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Museum+of+Love&came_from=67","description":"Ft.
