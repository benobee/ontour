of music's biggest stars -- from Elvis Presley (\"And I Love You So\") to Madonna (her No. 1 recording of \"American Pie\") -- have recorded one of legendary singer-songwriter Don McLean's classic hits. His most famous song, the iconic \"American Pie,\" holds a spot in the Grammy Hall of Fame and was voted No. 5 in a poll of the 365 \"Songs of the 20th Century,\" but his other beloved tunes include \"Vincent (Starry, Starry Night),\" \"Castles in the Air,\" \"And I Love You So\" and \"Crying.\" Since first hitting the charts in 1971, McLean's earned over 40 gold and platinum records worldwide, been inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame and been awarded the 2012 BBC Lifetime Achievement Award. See this great American troubadour in concert when he performs at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills.","artists":[{"id":28502,"name":"Don
