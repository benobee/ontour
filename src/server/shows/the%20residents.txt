acuité. Depuis plus de 40 ans, The Residents portent un regard caustique sur la pop culture. Loin d'être un groupe parodique, ils portent le fer là où les industries culturelles se mettent le doigt dans l'oeil. Mais les Residents sont-ils vraiment un groupe ? Bien avant Daft Punk, le plus connu des groupes d'inconnus a toujours entretenu le mystère sur l'identité de ses membres. Mondialement identifiés comme collectif pluridisciplinaire vêtus de smokings, visages le plus souvent dissimulés par des globes oculaires, coiffés de hauts de forme, les Residents sont plus une fraternité sans bannière qu'une franchise. D'illustres pré-Anonymous exhibant l'envers, l'enfer du décor de la société du spectacle et du simulacre existentiel. Un faisceau fantôme puisant sa source dans le bouillonnement psychédélique d'une Californie en surchauffe et les rivages des avant-gardes musicales, mutant au fil d'une discographie pléthorique et prémonitoire. Groupe à agrégation aléatoire, The Residents infiltrent l'ensemble des supports et médias disponibles. Pour ce spectacle inédit In Between Dreams, remontée acide d'un titre fameux de leur cultissime Commercial Album, nos conspirateurs s'affublent de masques à bec de corbin, évoquant autant la peste, le carnaval vénitien que notre moyen-âge numérique. Un rituel futuriste qui pique les oreilles et crève les yeux, libérant l'onirisme de chacun pour mieux interpréter le prétendu réel. Une remise en cause libertaire, où le questionnement est la solution. Nul besoin d'être initié pour savourer ce corrosif opéra de poche. Une comédie sonore et visuelle où les Residents accouchent par régurgitation de leur pulpe historique et incantations épiphaniques. Une nouvelle gestation, fruit de quatre décennies d'unions contre-nature imbriquant blues, punk, indus, electro, théâtre, multimédia, sous les regards concupiscents de Captain Beefheart, Pere Ubu, Devo, Eugene Chadbourne, Half Japanese, Butthole Surfers, Mr. Bungle... Une évolution des Residents, comme disent les Pokémaniaques, qui encore aujourd'hui se voit offrir la couverture du magazine de l'internationale des avant-gardes : The Wire. In Between Dreams : une œuvre de parents inconnus mais dont seuls les Résidents peuvent en revendiquer la paternité.

Leurs morceaux peuvent durer 17 minutes comme une minute. Ils abordent presque tous les styles musicaux : pop-rock, jazz, musique d’avant garde, new-wave, musique contemporaine, bande-son de documentaire… Les Residents ne respectent aucune règle et se plaisent à associer des sonorités très surprenantes pour composer. Ils bénéficient d’une grande crédibilité auprès de nombreux musiciens grâce à leur attitude en marge du music-bizness. Leur discographie bizarroïde a permis aux Residents d’être les parrains éloignés du mouvement punk d’avant garde. On peut rapprocher leur musique du travail de Frank Zappa et de Captain Beefheart : comme ces deux artistes, ils cherchent toujours à surprendre.","artists":[{"id":32990,"name":"The Residents","mbid":"8c9b336e-acc8-4e20-9195-6ed0634da9fc","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5021152.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5021152.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheResidents/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":27586,"url":"TheResidents","website":"http://www.residents.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Le Tetris","place":"Le Tetris","city":"Le Havre","region":null,"country":"France","latitude":49.502771,"longitude":0.1223904},"ontour_id":"zgxp2Crddihet4N8Q","genres":["art rock","experimental","experimental rock","fourth world","industrial","industrial rock","kraut rock","no wave","outsider","post-punk","uk post-punk","zolo"]},{"id":15538992,"artist_id":32990,"artist_event_id":19862795,"title":"The Residents @ Bremen Teater in København V, Denmark","datetime":"2017-11-11T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, November 11, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"København V, Denmark","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-03-15T09:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15538992?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Residents&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":32990,"name":"The Residents","mbid":"8c9b336e-acc8-4e20-9195-6ed0634da9fc","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5021152.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5021152.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheResidents/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":27586,"url":"TheResidents","website":"http://www.residents.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Bremen Teater","place":"Bremen Teater","city":"København V","region":null,"country":"Denmark","latitude":55.676861,"longitude":12.561093},"ontour_id":"zgxp2Crddihet4N8Q","genres":["art rock","experimental","experimental rock","fourth world","industrial","industrial rock","kraut rock","no wave","outsider","post-punk","uk post-punk","zolo"]},{"id":14303842,"artist_id":32990,"artist_event_id":18166764,"title":"The Residents @ John Dee in Oslo, Norway","datetime":"2017-11-12T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, November 12, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Oslo, Norway","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-03-31T07:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14303842?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Residents&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":32990,"name":"The Residents","mbid":"8c9b336e-acc8-4e20-9195-6ed0634da9fc","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5021152.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5021152.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheResidents/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":27586,"url":"TheResidents","website":"http://www.residents.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"John Dee","place":"John Dee","city":"Oslo","region":"Norway","country":"Norway","latitude":59.912281,"longitude":10.74998},"ontour_id":"zgxp2Crddihet4N8Q","genres":["art rock","experimental","experimental rock","fourth world","industrial","industrial rock","kraut rock","no wave","outsider","post-punk","uk post-punk","zolo"]},{"id":14365421,"artist_id":32990,"artist_event_id":18251478,"title":"The Residents @ Kampnagel in Hamburg, Germany","datetime":"2017-11-15T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Hamburg, Germany","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-04-07T16:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14365421?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Residents&came_from=67","description":"The Residents, die Meister surrealer Avant-Garde-Musik, kommen 2017 live nach Deutschland!

Ces freaks multimédias, devenus icônes malgré eux de la contre-culture américaine, as du détournement et de la parodie caustique, n’ont cessé d’expérimenter. Ils ont sorti près de 60 albums, transformé le CD-rom et le DVD en formes artistiques, produit des fictions radiophoniques podcastées sur le net, des vidéos fantasmatiques et grotesques mêlant allégrement techniques et supports (du Super 8 à la 3D) et livré de mémorables performances live, inspirant une foule de descendants pop ou électro comme Devo ou encore Daft Punk. Pour In Between Dreams, comédie sonore et visuelle inspirée des 500 morceaux de leur catalogue,The Residents invite le public sur un terrain imaginaire où l’art de poser des questions surpasse l’art des réponses… La conscience apporte-elle la réalité ou bien une illusion ultime appelée tout simplement la vie ?
