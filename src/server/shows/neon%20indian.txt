Luckily, the best of the best from the movement survived, including Denton's Neon Indian. Headed by Alan Palomo, the principal songwriter and performer, the band has found their niche in electronic rock, with Palomo exploring increasingly diverse landscapes as his career treads on. They were strong out of the gate, but if new single “Slumlord” is any indication, their next album, VEGA INTL. Night School will be their greatest work yet. Don't miss out on the music, or Palomo's superb dancing, when they hit Fitz in October.","artists":[{"id":304870,"name":"Neon
