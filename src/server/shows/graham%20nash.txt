December 5th 2016 Steve Earle and The Dukes are hosting the 2nd annual benefit concert to help raise important funds for children diagnosed with Autism. This will be the only show in New York City in which Steve Earle and The Dukes will be performing his debut album Guitar Town which came out in 1985 in its entirety. Joined by Graham Nash and Shawn Colvin this evening of amazing music is sure to be a memorable one. All net proceeds raised by ticket sales will be donated to The Keswell School formerly known as The McCarton School an educational program for children and young adults with Autism. Founded on the belief that children diagnosed with ASD can live full and productive lives as integrated members of their communities The Keswell School provides educational therapeutic and supportive services for children diagnosed with ASD and their families.This is a topic dear to Steve as his 5 year old son John Henry attends the school.","artists":[{"id":47159,"name":"Graham
