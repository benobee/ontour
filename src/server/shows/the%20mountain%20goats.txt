collaborative presentation of songs from Transcendental Youth, a new work by John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats (\"one of America's most startling lyricists,\" Boston Globe). Anonymous 4, celebrating their 25th anniversary, are famous for their purity of tone and astounding blend, gaining wide recognition for their intense scholarship and attention to historical context, both in medieval and early American repertoire.\r\n\r\nTranscendental Youth features new songs from Darnielle, heard here in special arrangements for voices, piano and guitar by the acclaimed musical polymath Owen Pallett. The songs visit a small community on Puget Sound in Washington, north of Seattle at the foot of Glacier Peak, and are inhabited by the mournful voices of the isolated and the lost in motels and apartment complexes around Snohomish County.\r\n\r\nA short solo Mountain Goats set begins the evening, followed by Anonymous 4 performing selections from their rich catalog in a program curated by both Darnielle and A4, and concluding with the collaborative performance.\r\n\r\n","artists":[{"id":5975,"name":"The Mountain Goats","mbid":"9639cd52-c351-4a17-9797-58880e95a7ef","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7517383.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7517383.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheMountainGoats/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/the-Mountain-Goats/17314008126","tracker_count":136420,"url":"TheMountainGoats","website":"http://www.mountain-goats.com"},{"id":29622,"name":"Anonymous 4","mbid":"bdbd99ab-3f4b-4028-9306-cd71d8695fbc","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Anonymous4/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4233,"url":"Anonymous4","website":"http://www.anonymous4.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Merkin Concert Hall","place":"Merkin Concert Hall","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.774973,"longitude":-73.982515},"ontour_id":"aAYc9rzHCWAjQsKHE","genres":["alternative rock","anti-folk","chamber pop","folk-pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","melancholia","neo-psychedelic","new weird america","noise pop","singer-songwriter","slow core","stomp and holler"]},{"id":4753513,"artist_id":5975,"artist_event_id":3974652,"title":"The Mountain Goats @ The Barbican in London, United Kingdom","datetime":"2012-04-02T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Monday, April 2, 2012 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"London, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/4753513?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Mountain+Goats&came_from=67","description":"with Anonymous 4","artists":[{"id":5975,"name":"The Mountain Goats","mbid":"9639cd52-c351-4a17-9797-58880e95a7ef","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7517383.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7517383.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheMountainGoats/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/the-Mountain-Goats/17314008126","tracker_count":136420,"url":"TheMountainGoats","website":"http://www.mountain-goats.com"}],"venue":{"name":"The Barbican","place":"The Barbican","city":"London","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.519812,"longitude":-0.093919},"ontour_id":"aAYc9rzHCWAjQsKHE","genres":["alternative rock","anti-folk","chamber pop","folk-pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","melancholia","neo-psychedelic","new weird america","noise pop","singer-songwriter","slow core","stomp and holler"]},{"id":5074432,"artist_id":5975,"artist_event_id":4606161,"title":"The Mountain Goats @ Benefit to Defeat Amendment One!
