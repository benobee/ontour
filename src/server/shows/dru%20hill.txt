Now, lead singer Sisqo -- the platinum blonde powerhouse who went solo and unleashed the inescapable \"Thong Song\" -- reunites with his Dru Hill bandmates to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their breakthrough self-titled album. They'll bring their swagger-filled harmonies and on-point choreography to New York's Lehman Center for the Performing Arts. Joining them on the bill are Grammy-nominated singer-songwriters Jon B.

So they may not dominate radio waves anymore but they still churn out new music and performances for their loyal fanbases who yearn for the silky ballads and party anthems the groups have delivered for decades now.

The ShoWare Center in Kent is set to welcome two of the most successful R&B supergroups of their era -- Tony! Toni! Toné! and Dru Hill, among many more. Tony! Toni! Toné! exploded out of Oakland in 1988 as the kings of New Jack Swing, with hit single \"Little Walter,\" and follow-ups like \"Feels Good,\" \"Whatever You Want\" and \"The Blues.\" Led by the unique voice and wild charisma of bleached-blond Sisqo (of \"Thong Song\" fame), Dru Hill ruled the charts with seven Top 40 hits, including \"In My Bed,\" \"Never Make a Promise\" and \"How Deep Is Your Love.\" Also on the bill are Silk, Htown and Total, plus guest performances by hip-hop legends Dana Dane, Special Ed, Kwame, Moni Love and Chubb Rock. All of the proceeds raised go to benefit the Greater Educational Milestones program, which helps students from low-income areas attend private high schools.","artists":[{"id":26062,"name":"Dru

Proof of their immense global following was most evident when their reality show entitled Keith Sweat's Platinum House became the highest rated series in the Centric network's history, proving their critics wrong that even after a significant absence from the public eye, fans still can't get enough of Dru Hill.","artists":[{"id":26062,"name":"Dru Hill","mbid":"2d7d0a67-ae5d-4ac0-93aa-aa52ef3a976a","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5810377.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5810377.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DruHill/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":59809,"url":"DruHill","website":"http://druhillonline.com"}],"venue":{"name":"B.B.
