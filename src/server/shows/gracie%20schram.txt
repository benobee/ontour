This past year, 200,000 students attended We Day and left inspired to create change at local and global levels.\n\nYou can‚Äôt buy a ticket to We Day. Students earn their event tickets by taking one local and one global action through We Schools, our yearlong educational program that engages and empowers young people to become compassionate leaders and active citizens. Some students collect food for homeless shelters. Others raise money to build classrooms overseas. Every young person makes their own journey to We Day, but together, they discover their power to change the world.","artists":[{"id":1876065,"name":"Gracie Schram","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7865564.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7865564.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GracieSchram/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gracieschram","tracker_count":2132,"url":"GracieSchram","website":null},{"id":25893,"name":"Ciara","mbid":"03172286-f7ed-4864-a4db-459cd5ca9790","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Ciara/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":854603,"url":"Ciara","website":"http://www.ciaraworld.com/"},{"id":592139,"name":"Darren Criss","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DarrenCriss/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Darren%20Criss/99840369146","tracker_count":176762,"url":"DarrenCriss","website":null},{"id":10215341,"name":"Nico and Vinz","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/NicoAndVinz/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/nicoandvinz","tracker_count":308817,"url":"NicoAndVinz","website":""},{"id":26328,"name":"Kardinal Offishall","mbid":"03647192-f55b-42b2-9a74-db28fcae8fd1","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KardinalOffishall/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":57010,"url":"KardinalOffishall","website":"http://googrecords.com"},{"id":2605939,"name":"Lily Collins","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/LilyCollins/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":2163,"url":"LilyCollins","website":null},{"id":899725,"name":"Henry Winkler","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HenryWinkler/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":148,"url":"HenryWinkler","website":null},{"id":12818490,"name":"Chelsea Clinton","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ChelseaClinton/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":529,"url":"ChelseaClinton","website":null},{"id":231378,"name":"Marlee Matlin","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MarleeMatlin/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":104,"url":"MarleeMatlin","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"WE Day -

Shortly after placing second in the competition, Lauren signed her record deal with 19/Interscope/Mercury Records.¬†  Her debut album, WILDFLOWER, was the portrait of the then-16-year-old's personality, optimism, and life experiences. The album spawned the hits LIKE MY MOTHER DOES, GEORGIA PEACHES, and 18 INCHES, and helped earn Lauren the 2012 title of New Artist of the Year by the American Country Awards.¬†  After years of touring with everyone from Sugarland to Alan Jackson to Jason Aldean, Lauren has spent much of 2014 writing songs with Nashville's best craftsmen for her 2015 album release.","artists":[{"id":1876065,"name":"Gracie Schram","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7865564.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7865564.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GracieSchram/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gracieschram","tracker_count":2132,"url":"GracieSchram","website":null},{"id":1345597,"name":"Lauren Alaina","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/LaurenAlaina/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lauren%20Alaina/105000049578720","tracker_count":172760,"url":"LaurenAlaina","website":null},{"id":1876065,"name":"Gracie Schram","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GracieSchram/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gracieschram","tracker_count":2132,"url":"GracieSchram","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Lauren Alaina with Special Guest Gracie Schram","place":"Kanza Hall","city":"Overland Park","region":"KS","country":"United States","latitude":38.915514,"longitude":-94.67212},"ontour_id":"G6P5biYevNuNit6Ag","genres":[]},{"id":12304554,"artist_id":1876065,"artist_event_id":15381006,"title":"Gracie Schram @ ModCloth IRL - Pop Up Store and Live Music in Washington, DC","datetime":"2016-06-22T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Washington, DC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12304554?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Gracie+Schram&came_from=67","description":"The online clothing brand , ModClothm is stopping & popping up all across the US this summer!
