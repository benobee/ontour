Hitchcock is one of England's most enduring contemporary singer/songwriters and live performers. A surrealist poet, talented guitarist, cult artist and musician's musician, Hitchcock is among alternative rock's father figures and is the closest thing the genre has to a Bob Dylan (not coincidentally his biggest musical inspiration).\n\nSince founding the art-rock band The Soft Boys in 1976, Robyn has recorded more than 20 albums as well as starred in 'Storefront Hitchcock' an in concert film recorded in New York and directed by Jonathan Demme.\n\nBlending folk and psychedelia with a wry British nihilism, Robyn describes his songs as 'paintings you can listen to'. His most recent album THE MAN UPSTAIRS is a bittersweet love letter to a vanishing world. Produced by legendary folk-rock svengali Joe Boyd (Pink Floyd, Nick Drake) the album was critically acclaimed by MOJO, UNCUT and THE QUIETUS.\n\n\"A gifted melodist, Hitchcock nests engaging lyrics in some of the most bracing, rainbow-hued pop this side of Revolver. He wrests inspiration not from ordinary life but from extraordinary imaginings…\" – Rolling Stone\n\n\"As a performer, he's as much a wandering bard as a rock star.\" – The Believer\n\nEMMA SWIFT\n\nFlaxen of hair, soul-tough and pretty as a diamond, with a tear in her voice filtered through '70s mariachi static, Emma Swift's music hearkens back to the golden age of music when singers sang your life back to you. It is a voice of pure heartbreak, delivering songs that are equal parts heart-worn and careworn, modern, insouciant, witty and feminist.\n\nA lonesome-voiced singer and award-winning radio broadcaster in her hometown of Sydney, it was a move away from Australia to Nashville, Tennessee that inspired Emma to write and record her solo debut.\n\n\"I left Australia with two suitcases, three pairs of cowboy boots and enough vinyl to make sure the first piece of furniture I bought when I arrived in Tennessee was a record player. I went in search of songs, in search of kindred spirits, in search of mythical honky-tonks and late-night picking parties. I went with a dream no bigger than to find a place where music might matter as much to the town as it does to me,\" says Swift.\n\nOne of Australia's finest sad-song-singers, Emma's voice has always required the kind of backing that would do it justice, and thanks to Nashville-based Australian expat Anne McCue and a cast of A-team Nashville session pickers, Swift's songs have been wrought from (pedal) steel and amber, turquoise and honey.\n\nThe debut mini-album features Bryan Owings (Buddy Miller, Emmylou Harris, Iris Dement, Patty Griffin) on drums, Russ Pahl (John Hiatt, The Secret Sisters, Elton John) on pedal steel, James Haggerty (The Autumn Defense, Ruby Boots) on bass.\n\nOpener 'Bittersweet' is of the type that once sold albums and singles by the millions, a heartbreaker to make one yearn for whiskey, a jukebox and a handful of dollar coins.\n\n'King of America' sees Swift leaning hard, unashamedly even on the bluesy turn in her throat, with enough grit and power to have Loretta Lynn raising an eyebrow.\n\nSwift wraps her golden voice around 'James', a true sad song of the kind that – like waltzes – once had Willie Nelson wondering if there was any reason to keep writing them. Of course, her treatment of the lyric leaves the listener in no doubt that she's hurting.\n\n'Seasons', a staple of Swift's live set for years sounds like it belongs on a beat up AM radio some summer long ago.\n\nThe songs are imbued with an easy smile, vulnerability and toughness calling to mind artists like Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Tammy Wynette, Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star, or Margo Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies.\n","artists":[{"id":40131,"name":"Robyn

THE HOST\nThis dinner is being hosted by a lovely human in a private home. The address will be shared with the purchase of a ticket.\nABOUT THE DREAM DATES TOUR\nDream Dates is a national pop-up dinner and house concert tour featuring the perfectly melancholy Nashville-based songbird, Emma Swift, Tucson-by-way-of-El Paso musician and songwriter, HOLLY, and French trained nomadic chef and founder of Underground Fine Dining, Dustin Brandt.\nThe tour includes large public concerts and intimate, region-specific, seasonally-appropriate, and locally-sourced tasting dinners in unconventional spaces like living rooms, record stores, design warehouses, yoga studios, and, of course, chocolate factories. Emma and HOLLY also have extra special special guest artists like Robyn Hitchcock, Devotional, Shelley Short, Shelby Earl, and Amy Nelson (of Folk Uke) joining them along the way.\nABOUT THE DREAM DATES TALENT\nEmma Swift is a wandering songwriter who splits her time between Sydney, Australia and Nashville, Tennessee. A fan of minor chords, gin and endless pedal steel, she likes to play vulnerable music. Her heroes, in no particular order are: Gram Parsons, Bill Callahan, Anais Nin, Lucinda Williams, and whoever invented dry shampoo. Emma was nominated for an ARIA Award (Australian GRAMMY Award) for her debut release.\nwww.emmaswift.com.au\nHolly Muñoz (aka HOLLY) is a musician and songwriter from El Paso, Texas. She has made two records with John Vanderslice at his all-analog studio, Tiny Telephone: Maps and Lists and #2 Record, a double LP featuring Alan Sparhawk (of Low), Ken Stringfellow (of R.E.M., Big Star, The Posies), Andy Stochansky (of Ani DiFranco), John Hermanson (of Storyhill), and Brian Tighe (of The Hang Ups and Starfolk). She is also one-half of Holly & Ken, an indie country opera project with Ken Stringfellow featuring Vicki Peterson (of The Bangles), Matthew Caws (of Nada Surf), Keren Ann, Shelby Earl, and Country Dave Harmonson. Holly recently recorded her third solo album, Little Thief in Los Angeles with Ken Stringfellow and Pete Thomas (of Elvis Costello). She is currently touring and working on a collection of obscure covers called, If It Wasn't For Second Chances, We Would All Be Alone.\nwww.iamonteamholly.com\nChef Dustin Brandt, founder of Underground Fine Dining, is a French trained chef who applies classic techniques to modern global cuisine. Prior to hitting the road with his inspiring menus and inventive business model, Dustin spent five years in Boulder, Colorado working at Frasca Food and Wine and as chef de cuisine at Latelier. He has preapred dinners in hundreds of unconventional locations around the world and creates tasting menus based on region, seasonality, and the inspiration of the space.\nwww.undergroundfinedining.com","artists":[{"id":40131,"name":"Robyn Hitchcock","mbid":"0584e561-1442-46c9-9593-923c34571eb7","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7438147.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7438147.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/RobynHitchcock/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Robyn%20Hitchcock/269949063038257","tracker_count":19715,"url":"RobynHitchcock","website":"http://www.robynhitchcock.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Private Home","place":"Private Home","city":"Memphis","region":"TN","country":"United States","latitude":35.1494444,"longitude":-90.0488889},"ontour_id":"djsMWSp57XzDYKrhR","genres":["alternative rock","anti-folk","art rock","chamber pop","dream pop","indie christmas","jangle pop","lo-fi","neo-psychedelic","new wave","post-punk","power pop","singer-songwriter","slow core","uk post-punk"]},{"id":12327550,"artist_id":40131,"artist_event_id":15412667,"title":"Robyn Hitchcock @ Fremont Abbey Arts Centre in Seattle, WA","datetime":"2016-10-04T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Seattle, WA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12327550?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Robyn+Hitchcock&came_from=67","description":"About Robyn Hitchcock:\n\n\"A gifted melodist, Hitchcock nests engaging lyrics in some of the most bracing, rainbow-hued pop this side of Revolver.

in London in 1953, Robyn Hitchcock has written & recorded over 500 songs, including: 'Where Are The Prawns' 'I Wanna Destroy You' 'The Cheese Alarm' 'Sometimes A Blonde' 'No, I Don't Remember Guildford' 'To Be Human' 'Where Do You Go When You Die' 'Uncorrected Personality Trains' 'Full Moon in My Soul' 'Chinese Bones' 'Madonna Of The Wasps' and recently a lament for the Arctic polar thaw 'There Goes The Ice', recorded with KT Tunstall, with whom he was on a Cape Farewell environmental expedition to Greenland in 2008.\n\nSince founding the art-rock band The Soft Boys in 1976, Robyn has played with many respected musicians including John Paul Jones, Gillian Welch & Dave Rawlings, Peter Buck, Nick Lowe, Abigail Washburn, Grant Lee Phillips, Martin & Liza Carthy, Howe Gelb, Krystle Warren, Graham Coxon and Johnny Marr among others.\n\nin 1996 Jonathan Demme directed an in-concert film of Robyn in New York 'Storefront Hitchcock' and in 2003 cast him in his remake of 'The Manchurian Candidate' and in 2007 'Rachel Getting Married'.\n\nRobyn describes his songs as 'paintings you can listen to'. His most recent album LOVE FROM LONDON celebrates life in a culture imperiled by economic and environmental collapse.\n\n'These are exciting times' he adds 'we are surfing on the momentum of chaos. If a consensus on global warming comes from the people, then the media, the politicians, and the corporations will have to adapt to it. Rock and Roll is an old man's game now, so I'm staying in it'\n\n","artists":[{"id":40131,"name":"Robyn

Rowan Hitchcock (born 3 March 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano and bass guitar.\n\nComing to prominence in the late 1970s with The Soft Boys, Hitchcock afterward launched a prolific solo career. His musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Syd Barrett. Hitchcock's lyrics tend to include surrealism, comedic elements, characterisations of English eccentrics, and melancholy depictions of everyday life.\n\nHe was signed to two major American labels (A&M Records, then Warner Bros.) over the course of the 1980s and '90s, but mainstream success has been limited. He has maintained a loyal cult following and has often earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances.","artists":[{"id":40131,"name":"Robyn

to follow up with a remark that had everyone in the audience rolling, \"Jesus -- the missing years. He was doing stand-up then. That explains why they took such drastic measures to shut him up.\"\n\nHitchcock's wry, thought-provoking humor feels at times out of place. At other times, however, that very same humor is the type of comic relief necessary after a deeply moving scene in a film. Filled with plenty of laughs filled and equally poignant moments, his music and his monologues fit together perfectly like a quirky old couple who knows what the other is going to say or do even before they do.\n\nNearing 62, Hitchcock played a career-spanning set, including songs from the Soft Boys to last year's album The Man Upstairs. With his white mop of hair looking like Peter Pan would have today had he been in a rock and roll band, the boy who never grew up could no longer avoid the certain fate his age brings.","artists":[{"id":40131,"name":"Robyn

Hitchcock is one of England's most enduring contemporary singer/songwriters and live performers. A surrealist poet, talented guitarist, cult artist and musician's musician, Hitchcock is among alternative rock's father figures and is the closest thing the genre has to a Bob Dylan (not coincidentally his biggest musical inspiration).\n\nSince founding the art-rock band The Soft Boys in 1976, Robyn has recorded more than 20 albums as well as starred in ‘Storefront Hitchcock’ an in concert film recorded in New York and directed by Jonathan Demme. \n\nBlending folk and psychedelia with a wry British nihilism, Robyn describes his songs as ‘paintings you can listen to’. His most recent album is self-titled and marks his 21st release as a solo artist. Out on April 21 2017, the album is produced by Brendan Benson (The Raconteurs). Hitchcock describes it as a \"ecstatic work of negativity with nary a dreary groove.\" \n\nIt has received rave reviews from UNCUT, Rolling Stone, Paste, Tidal and more. \n\n\"A gifted melodist, Hitchcock nests engaging lyrics in some of the most bracing, rainbow-hued pop this side of Revolver. He wrests inspiration not from ordinary life but from extraordinary imaginings...\" - Rolling Stone\n\n\"These 10 gems slither, rock, roll, glide and shapeshift, coalescing around Hitchcock’s typically anxious, strained but striking and immediately identifiable vocals.\" - American Songwriter\n\n\"Beloved of everyone from Led Zeppelin to REM, Hitchcock has only enhanced his status with this wonderful outing.\" - Hot Press\n\n\"Witty, moving and seriously catchy, Robyn Hitchcock is a glorious return for a man who wasn’t really gone in the first place.\" - Paste
