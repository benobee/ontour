With the passage of the federal education law – Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), CMA and the CMA Foundation have invited these artists and other music industry influencers to meet with congressional representatives to reinforce the importance of music education. \nSince 2006, CMA and the CMA Foundation have donated more than $13.6 million to music education initiatives across the country, benefitting 30 in- and after-school programs. Guided by the generosity of the Country Music community, the CMA Foundation focuses on improving and sustaining music education programs everywhere while supporting worthwhile causes important to the Country Music Association. Donations are made on behalf of the artists who perform each year, for free, during CMA Music Festival. \nKristian Bush is a Grammy-winning recording artist who has left his mark on music for more than two decades. The singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist started his career with folk-rock duo Billy Pilgrim in the early '90s; in 2004, he exploded onto the country music scene with Sugarland, surpassing sales of over 22 million albums worldwide, achieving five No. 1 singles and winning numerous awards, including Grammys, AMAs, ACMs, CMT Music Awards and CMAs. In 2014, Bush made his solo debut with Top 20 hit \"Trailer Hitch,\" featured on his critically-acclaimed album SOUTHERN GRAVITY, which COUNTRY WEEKLY named the \"feel-good album of the year.\" He recently wrote and performed \"Forever Now,\" the theme song to TLC's hit reality series SAY YES TO THE DRESS, and his songs will anchor the world premiere of TROUBADOUR, a play set in 1950s Nashville, debuting at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre Center in 2017. For more information, visit www.kristianbush.com. \nCharlie Worsham broke onto the country music charts in 2013 with Warner Bros., releasing his first single, \"Could It Be.\" A native of Greneda, Tennessee, Worsham studied at the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston before moving south to Nashville, dividing his time between writing songs, being an in-demand studio musician for other artists and playing his music live – sharing stages across the country on recent tours with Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert and others. \nNo attendees under 21 allowed: You must be 21 years of age or older and present photo ID at the door to attend.","artists":[{"id":160939,"name":"Kristian Bush","mbid":"f9c9f944-e04c-499b-9c09-bf158b5d1acf","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8209240.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8209240.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KristianBush/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KristianBushOfficial/","tracker_count":21669,"url":"KristianBush","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"National Press Club","place":"National Press Club","city":"Washington","region":"DC","country":"United States","latitude":38.896986,"longitude":-77.031257},"ontour_id":"SAbs5t9ufqgSjEc9x","genres":["contemporary country","country","country road","modern country rock"]},{"id":12331541,"artist_id":160939,"artist_event_id":15417057,"title":"Kristian Bush @ Elizabeth Park in Trenton, MI","datetime":"2016-07-30T13:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, July 30, 2016 at 1:00PM","formatted_location":"Trenton, MI","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12331541?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Kristian+Bush&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":160939,"name":"Kristian Bush","mbid":"f9c9f944-e04c-499b-9c09-bf158b5d1acf","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8209240.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8209240.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KristianBush/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KristianBushOfficial/","tracker_count":21669,"url":"KristianBush","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Elizabeth Park","place":"Elizabeth Park","city":"Trenton","region":"MI","country":"United States","latitude":42.1519508,"longitude":-83.1757202},"ontour_id":"SAbs5t9ufqgSjEc9x","genres":["contemporary country","country","country road","modern country rock"]},{"id":12075051,"artist_id":160939,"artist_event_id":15071920,"title":"Kristian Bush @ 883 Highland Ave SE in Hickory, NC","datetime":"2016-08-12T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, August 12, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Hickory, NC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12075051?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Kristian+Bush&came_from=67","description":"DOORS – The doors will open at 8pm and the show will begin at approximately 8:30pm. The beginning and end of a set is at the discretion of the performing act, although we contract them for a minimum set length. SEATING – There is no seating available. Our concerts are STANDING ROOM ONLY. PARKING – Please follow the signage and the directions of our parking lot attendants to find parking in our FREE concert parking lots. TICKETS – Tickets are $20 in advance and $25 at the door the night of the show.\nKristian Bush has a voice.\nAnd after more than a dozen years as the creative yet largely silent force behind Sugarland — the Grammy, CMA and ACM Award-winning group he formed in Atlanta in 2003 — the Tennessee-born singer-songwriter is ready for you to hear it.\nOn his debut solo album Southern Gravity (out April 7 via Streamsound Records), that voice is undeniable.\nSouthern Gravity is a joyous and inspirational album, yet it was born out of tumultuous, even tragic, change. As such, it is a purging of all that Kristian has weathered since 2011 — the year that the stage rigging collapsed during a storm prior to Sugarland's show at the Indiana State Fair. That horrific accident was the first of many challenges, both public and personal, for the heart-on-his-sleeve artist.\nOver its dozen tracks, however, Southern Gravity became Kristian's musical assurance that everything was going to be okay.\n\"These songs are like post-it notes that you might put around your house as inspirational reminders,\" says Kristian. \"I listen to them for that reason sometimes — to remind myself that no matter how hard it gets, you can make things out of the pieces that are smashed.\"\nIt's testament to Kristian's gift for writing perfect country-pop hooks that Southern Gravity turned out to be, as Country Weekly puts it, “the feel-good album of the year.” Whether it's the narrator who gives away his worldly possessions in lead single and Top 20 hit \"Trailer Hitch,\" the brokenhearted soul who seeks solace in the Golden State in \"Feeling Fine California,\" or the guy who celebrates the elation of being in love in \"Light Me Up,\" the voices of the record unfailingly live in the moment.\n\"Music sometimes looks back, and that's what most of us do. But this album is all present tense. It's not I was feeling fine, it's I am feeling fine. It isn't you did light me up, it's you do light me up. It's all happening here,\" Kristian says. \"And I needed to hear that as much as anyone else.\"\nStill, the man who was content to quietly steer the ship in Sugarland and cede the spotlight to the world-class entertainer that is Jennifer Nettles knows what you're thinking: \"This guy can sing?\"\nThe answer, in short, is damn straight. \"I think people might be very surprised; they may even have low expectations, like, 'I didn't think you had it in you, man!'\" Kristian says with a laugh.\nBut while he knew he could sing — and command a stage, as he did with revered cult band Billy Pilgrim in the Nineties — Kristian wanted to be certain he could write not just serviceable songs but great songs for what would be his debut solo project. To find the honest answer, he posed an ego-testing question.\n\"I asked myself, 'What if people have been yessing me for the last few years? Maybe the songs aren't that good. How in the world will I ever know if I was getting away with mediocrity?'\" he recalls. \"So I went wandering.\"\nHe traveled to Los Angeles, Stockholm, London, and Nashville — eventually purchasing a home in Music City to more fully immerse himself — writing with some of music's most creative minds across all genres. Finally, he returned to Atlanta, where he recorded the heart of the album's twelve songs. The journey took commitment, as well as the courage to further the Sugarland narrative he started over a decade ago.\n\"I needed to continue the story of Sugarland, and I didn't know how this would fit in,\" he says of Southern Gravity. Ultimately, Kristian says, the album became an extension of his country-pop band, which to him felt entirely natural. \"This is me continuing the message in my music,\" he says, predicting that listeners will detect a similarity to Sugarland albums like Love on the Inside. \"As people look back through those records, it'll all make sense.\"\nTo be sure, tracks like \"Light Me Up,\" the breezy \"Flip Flops\" and the defiant \"Walk Tall\" evoke the sing-along anthems of Sugarland, fitting in perfectly on country radio. That, Kristian says, was his intention from the get-go — as well as something to be celebrated.\n\"I chose these songs to communicate with as many people as I can,\" he says. “Country radio has an incredible reach and is such a powerful thing. It is unprecedented in our culture. I want to be on the radio because I want people I don't know to hear my music. I've been pestering the ones I do know for years — it's the stranger that I'm interested in.”\nProduced by Kristian (a self-confessed studio geek) with help from long-time friend and acclaimed engineer Tom Tapley, Southern Gravity is a true headphones experience, a listening event meant to be explored and savored. Throughout, you’ll find plucky mandolin, resonating guitar, and layer upon layer of delicious harmonies. Empowered by honest, uplifting lyrics, it all adds up to one of the year's most satisfying — and cathartic — releases.\nFor fans of authentic, transformative songwriting, it will be hard to resist Southern Gravity's pull.\n\"Writing a happy, inspirational album can be very difficult, and to do it while you're crawling out from the mud is doubly difficult,\" says Kristian with a been-there smile. \"But when that muscle awakens, there's nothing more powerful.\"\n\nKristian Bush, one half of platinum-selling country duo Sugarland, has been leaving his mark on music for more than two decades. His debut solo album, Southern Gravity, was released in April 2015, featuring the Top 20 single \"Trailer Hitch.\" The album received rave reviews from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, and the Sydney Morning Herald, among many others. Country Weekly called it the \"feel-good album of the year.\"\nBush is a Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist who started his career with folk rock duo Billy Pilgrim in the early '90s. He and partner Andrew Hyra released a much-lauded pair of albums for Atlantic Records (their 1994 self-titled debut and 1995's Bloom), earning multiple Top 5 singles on the AAA charts, rotation on VH1, and a reputation as dynamic live performers who traveled from the tiny stage of Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia, to a worldwide tour supporting Melissa Etheridge in 1995.\nBush founded Sugarland in 2002; in 2004, he and singer Jennifer Nettles exploded onto the music scene, surpassing sales of over 22 million albums worldwide, achieving five No. 1 singles and winning numerous awards, including trophies from the Grammys, AMAs, ACM Awards, CMT Music Awards and CMA Awards. In October of 2012, they were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.\nTo date, Bush has won six BMI Awards for his songwriting abilities, and in 2011 founded the music publishing company and songwriting collective Songs of the Architect. Recent producing/songwriting collaborations include Mike Elizondo, Rita Wilson, Dia Frampton, Ellis Paul, Laura Bell Bundy, Matt Nathanson, the dB’s, Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls, Pretty Little Liars star Lucy Hale, and up-and-comers including Kristina Train, Larkin Poe, Natalie Stovall, Canaan Smith, Jaida Dreyer, Alana Springsteen, and The Voice contestant Savannah Berry.\nBush made his solo debut in March 2013 at the inaugural C2C: Country to Country Festival, held at the O2 Arena in London. His first release as a solo act, “Love or Money,” debuted in the UK and Europe the following week, and in October of 2013, he stood by his promise to release “Love or Money” at home in the US as well – the song is now available worldwide, and is featured in the hit mobile game My Singing Monsters, where Bush lends his voice to the green furry \"Shugabush.\"\nHe is a frequent panelist and speaker at events for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and regularly appears as part of the CMA Songwriters Series in cities across the U.S. and Europe. Bush is a graduate of Emory University in Atlanta, where he still resides.","artists":[{"id":160939,"name":"Kristian
