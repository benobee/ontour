His music is difficult to categorize, and has been described as anything ranging from straight Americana to Outer Space Folk.  His live shows are typically off beat and often humorous, blending musical performance with extemporaneous observations about life, love, faith, politics and the disposition of the

Magazine\r\nRaised in Pensacola, Florida, a town crushed between the church and heroin, Jim’s songs reach deep into the underbelly of the South. One time Pentacostal, fashion model, New York taxi driver, drifter, pro-surfer, photographer, film-maker, his music is the conduit for all the stories he collected along the way. His previous albums ‘Wrong-Eyed Jesus’ [1997], ‘No Such Place’ [2001] and ‘Drill a Hole in That Substrate…’ [2004] were acclaimed as masterpieces of ‘outer space alt.country’ and established Jim as a phenomenal maverick talent.\r\nJim also starred in the BBC4 film ‘Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus’, an award-winning road-movie exploring Southern culture through its music and stories. Now living in an old farmhouse in the backwoods of Georgia, Jim White may have finally reached a place called home, but his other search, for what he calls ‘the gold tooth in God’s crooked smile’ continues in this new set of backyard tales.\r\nHis live shows have been described as off-beat, blending his playlist with open discussion with the audience and anecdotes derived from his own life experiences, all of which is typically humorous and insightful.\r\n ","artists":[{"id":57541,"name":"Jim White","mbid":"18a981d6-fdd5-4bbe-a53d-f40d18950077","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/2973888.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/2973888.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JimWhite/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":7754,"url":"JimWhite","website":"http://www.JimWhite.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Cyprus Avenue","place":"Cyprus Avenue","city":"Cork","region":"Ireland","country":"Ireland","latitude":51.8986111,"longitude":-8.4958333},"ontour_id":"DhB6X9M7drxBudLvo","genres":["alternative country","anti-folk","country christmas","folk","gothic americana","new americana","roots rock","singer-songwriter","slow core","traditional folk"]},{"id":15859145,"artist_id":57541,"artist_event_id":20318974,"title":"Jim White @ Trail's End Cafe in Concord, MA","datetime":"2017-11-07T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, November 7, 2017 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Concord, MA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15859145?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jim+White&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":57541,"name":"Jim White","mbid":"18a981d6-fdd5-4bbe-a53d-f40d18950077","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/2973888.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/2973888.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JimWhite/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":7754,"url":"JimWhite","website":"http://www.JimWhite.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Trail's End Cafe","place":"Trail's End Cafe","city":"Concord","region":"MA","country":"United States","latitude":42.463053,"longitude":-71.351722},"ontour_id":"DhB6X9M7drxBudLvo","genres":["alternative country","anti-folk","country christmas","folk","gothic americana","new americana","roots rock","singer-songwriter","slow core","traditional folk"]},{"id":15329767,"artist_id":57541,"artist_event_id":19748933,"title":"Jim White @ The Soundhouse in Leicester, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-11-14T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Leicester, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-09-10T21:45:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15329767?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jim+White&came_from=67","description":"Jim White","artists":[{"id":57541,"name":"Jim White","mbid":"18a981d6-fdd5-4bbe-a53d-f40d18950077","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/2973888.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/2973888.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JimWhite/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":7754,"url":"JimWhite","website":"http://www.JimWhite.net"}],"venue":{"name":"The Soundhouse","place":"The Soundhouse","city":"Leicester","region":"England","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":52.6354344,"longitude":-1.1246514},"ontour_id":"DhB6X9M7drxBudLvo","genres":["alternative country","anti-folk","country christmas","folk","gothic americana","new americana","roots rock","singer-songwriter","slow core","traditional folk"]},{"id":14991444,"artist_id":57541,"artist_event_id":19105402,"title":"Jim White @ The HUBS in Sheffield, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-11-17T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, November 17, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Sheffield, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14991444?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jim+White&came_from=67","description":"Jim White gets around.

When he's not releasing his own critically acclaimed solo albums he splits time producing records for other songwriters, exhibiting his visual art in galleries and museums across the US and Europe and publishing award winning fiction.\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, the bizarrely titled Waffles, Triangles & Jesus, is a mind-bending joy ride of sonic influences featuring a bevy of his hometown Athens' roots musicians, plus west coast indie darlings Dead Rock West, and rock and roll maverick Holly Golightly.\n  \nPrior to Waffles, Triangles & Jesus, White released five eclectic, totally uncatagorizable albums plus another six even stranger side projects.\n\nNumerous songs from his back catalog have appeared both in film and television, with his Primus-esque Word-Mule being featured in Breaking Bad, and more recently his cautionary rocker Crash Into The Sun appearing in Ray McKinnon's highly praised Sundance Channel series Rectify.\n\nUK fans may recognize White as the narrator and defacto tour guide for the award winning BBC documentary, Searching for the Wrong Eyed Jesus, a road movie set in the rural South, which the LA Times described as Decidedly strange, delightfully demented.\n\nPrior to becoming a musician White led an aimless, diverse life, working countless menial labor jobs:  dishwasher, landscaper, lifeguard, cook, surfboard laminator, road builder, culminating with thirteen long years driving a taxi cab in New York City.   \n\nWhite is presently at work completing a memoir, Incidental Contact, based on a series of uncanny coincidences that befell him during his days driving that taxi in New York City. Two chapters of Incidental Contact, The Bottom and Superwhite, have been published in the literary music journal Radio Silence, with Superwhite being awarded a Pushcart Prize for short fiction.\n\nWhite was a pro surfer.  He served as literary commentator for the National Endowment of the Arts.  He was a European fashion model.  Samuel Beckett once played a practical joke on him.  There's lots more non linear information that doesn't really fit the usual bio format.   But that's Jimhe gets around.\n   \nhttp://www.jimwhite.net","artists":[{"id":57541,"name":"Jim
