Music and beer are two great bedfellows, and with The Phoenix Foundation and Garage Project both being born and bred Wellingtonian outfits, a partnership to collectively give up their dreams with the creation of New Zealand's finest craft draught was just good sense. More details on this exciting collaboration will be coming soon.\n \nThe prog-indie sextet have established themselves as firm favourites among local fans with their innovative, experimental sound and hypnotic live show and can’t wait to kick off the tour in Wellington on September 17th.

Festival is set to be a cracker with a number of artists including soulful country starlet Tami Neilson and six-piece local heroes The Eastern, together with more local talent in the form of Devilish Mary and the Holy Rollers and Fraser Ross.\n\nAfter two successful years, Nostalgia has established itself as an unmissable event. It has reinvigorated the heritage space for a modern audience by weaving together a growing list of local heroes, products and performers.\n\nThe festival’s director, Johnny Gibson, said “2016 is set to be a massive year for Nostalgia. We’ve grown the festival from the ground up with the passion of this city’s entrepreneurs and ongoing support from Christchurch City Council.”\n\n“If there’s one thing we’re about: it’s giving Christchurch an unparalleled opportunity to sample the best of its people, products and produce together, in harmony with the beauty of this unique environment.”\n\nThe daylong festival will centre around a main stage situated in the heritage town square, accompanied by Cassels & Sons’ craft beer tent, featuring a host of guest taps and the Golden Age; a beer brewed specially in celebration of Nostalgia.   Up and coming local acts will feature on the second stage, The Punch Club, with waterfront cocktails by Rogue Society gin and Mexican street food by Mamacita’s. Elsewhere, punters can enjoy a fully immersive wine-tasting tent experience by Winefolk, showcasing a selection of local wines and producers, a pick-me-up from the local caffeineistas Lyttelton Coffee Co and a smorgasbord of eats from the likes of Chef Alex Davies, Cakes by Anna, Bearlion and cult burger master Heisenburger, among others.   Beyond food and drink, festival goers can peruse bespoke arts and crafts at the Village Market, watch the wandering street performers or take time for an old-fashioned touch-up from the seasoned experts at New City Barbers.\n\nWith entertainment and attractions for all ages, including steam train rides from ‘Peveril’, the village’s original NZR F class steam train, there’s something for everyone at Nostalgia - a festival to remember.\n\nNostalgia Festival\n12.30pm -7.30pm \nSaturday 20 February 2016\n\n\n\nRead more: http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/10430/Acts-Revealed-For-Nostalgia-Festival-2016.utr#ixzz3rDqnPVEC","artists":[{"id":45298,"name":"The Phoenix Foundation","mbid":"edc72f81-e9b4-4b5a-b56f-cfd50b0d7913","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8225854.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8225854.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThePhoenixFoundation/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thephoenixfoundation","tracker_count":9960,"url":"ThePhoenixFoundation","website":"http://www.thephoenixfoundation.co.nz/"},{"id":1615151,"name":"Tami Neilson","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TamiNeilson/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":2150,"url":"TamiNeilson","website":null},{"id":776291,"name":"The Eastern","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheEastern/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":1522,"url":"TheEastern","website":null},{"id":2614594,"name":"Devilish Mary and the Holy Rollers","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DevilishMaryAndTheHolyRollers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":198,"url":"DevilishMaryAndTheHolyRollers","website":null},{"id":3379775,"name":"Fraser Ross","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/FraserRoss/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":343,"url":"FraserRoss","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Nostalgia Festival 2016","place":"Ferrymead Heritage Park","city":"Christchurch","region":null,"country":"New Zealand","latitude":-43.5673,"longitude":172.7023},"ontour_id":"rgNb9TPdA5jQ4Lp5x","genres":["kiwi rock","nz indie"]},{"id":10783616,"artist_id":45298,"artist_event_id":13295278,"title":"The Phoenix Foundation @ NZ Festival 2016 in Wellington, New Zealand","datetime":"2016-03-10T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Wellington, New Zealand","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2015-10-23T09:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/10783616?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Phoenix+Foundation&came_from=67","description":"Exclusive pre-sale for supporters of The Culture Club from 9am Fri 23 October.

Another fine vintage act set to rock The Others Way is Voom, with guitar-pop hits spanning decades.\n\nReturning with volume are post-punksters Cut Off Your Hands - playing a very special 2008 You & I album set.\n\nThe Phoenix Foundation will bring their trademark space voyager-rock, and road-tested groove-jets Shocking Pinks are back on home turf after an epic year of touring. Following the international success of their album Yoncalla, dream-poppers Yumi Zouma bring their polished, sun-dappled sounds back to New Zealand. Hot off the back of their new jam-laden album Norfolk Radio comes Ghost Wave and Zen Mantra's psychedelic shoegaze also returns from Brooklyn to the Auckland stage.\n\nAustralian janglers Twerps and Scott & Charlene’s Wedding are an exception to the local roster, bringing chime and charm in bucketloads. \n\nA select range of hip-hop acts are ready to rumble The Others Way with thanks to Max Oldfield from 95bFM. Young, Gifted & Broke collective are presenting a formidable force in the way of ENO X DIRTY, Spycc & INF and MeloDownz, while veteran rapper Louie Knuxx brings rhymes from his latest record Tiny Warm Hearts to the party. Badcrop complete the party.\n\nFazerdaze, Mermaidens, Courtney Hate, Emily Edrosa and much more round out the indie/rock sector; and did we mention fresh electro-R&B from Miloux, neo-folk from Purple Pilgrims, psych-tinged underwater jams from Scuba Diva, wild cinematic jazz from Carnivorous Plant Society and Yoko Zuna, cosmic ambience from Peach Milk and Shab Orkestra, alt-pop from Grayson Gilmour, plus so much more - The Others Way is truly an instant hit of the best local music on offer.\n\nIt's not just music, there's a book as well; namely a free early evening Q&A session with Flying Nun founder Roger Shepherd about In Love With These Times\n\nThe Others Way will be announcing more acts in the coming weeks.","artists":[{"id":45298,"name":"The Phoenix
