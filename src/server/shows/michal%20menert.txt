PLM Tour featuring Michal Menert, Eliot Lipp, SuperVision and Paul Basic will hit the road on September 23rd, 2014 making 24 stops across the Midwest, down the East Coast, and through the South.  Fans will enjoy a two-hour set with every artist on stage at the same time collaborating with each other while individually showcasing their own styles.\r\n \r\nThese artists have been a part of the Pretty Lights Music label for many years and have developed a deep musical bond that inspired this unique tour. It's an interactive experience has only happened once before with great success, and now here's your chance to see it live.\r\n\r\nMichal Menert\r\nGrowing up in Colorado, Michal Menert was surrounded by music. During his childhood, Michal’s father exposed him to a wide variety of Eastern and Western music, along with the guitar and keyboard. Additionally, dabbling in a variety of other instruments gave him a unique approach to crafting his own style. Michal’s most significant motivation is “the opportunity to chase a fleeting feeling that comes from certain moments in music, coupled with the privilege of having a platform to give audiences a glimpse into that feeling.”\r\nhttp://michalmenert.net/\r\n\r\nEliot Lipp\r\nAfter more than ten years of global touring, seven solo albums on labels such as Pretty Lights Music, Old Tacoma Records, Hefty, 1320 and Mush, Eliot Lipp's status as an electronic music pioneer is known to scene experts and weekend warriors alike.\r\nPerhaps this is what sets Lipp apart from the rest. He is a risk taker, not afraid to do something a little different.\r\nhttp://eliotlipp.com/\r\n\r\nSuperVision\r\n“My intention with my music, is to make futuristic electronic hip hop beats. The process I use comes from the school of thought from early hip hop, more specifically the late 80's early 90's - digging up old records and chopping them up to make something entirely new. That period influenced my beat making more than any. I then give my tracks that powerful electronic build out because it's fun, great for the dance floor, and I love doing it. \" Blake... aka SuperVision\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ThatSuperVision\r\n\r\nPaul Basic\r\nStarting out as a drummer, Colorado producer Paul Brandt aka Paul Basic joined a band with Derek Vincent Smith (Pretty Lights) and Michal Menert in high school before they each moved on to pursue solo production work.

for combining obscure vintage Eastern European and Western samples with hard-hitting electro beats, producer Michal Menert saw his dream come to life when an 18-piece ensemble performed his catalog in front of thousands at Sonic Bloom in June. Now, the Michal Menert Big Band will do it again, this time in Denver at the legendary Fillmore Auditorium on November 7th.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Colorado, Michal was surrounded by music. During his childhood, Michal’s father exposed him to a wide variety of styles, plus the guitar and keyboard and a variety of other instruments. Much of his catalog was created with orchestration in mind, so expanding the parts came naturally. \r\n\r\nWhile bringing 18 talented musicians together is a unique challenge, Michal is well suited for collaborating with artists that he respects and loves, as can be seen in his previous work with PLM label mates Pretty Lights, Break Science & Eliot Lipp, and in side projects like Half Color with Paul Basic and Manic Menert with Manic Focus.\r\n\r\nCome enjoy a look into what Michal describes as “the opportunity to chase a fleeting feeling that comes from certain moments in music, coupled with the privilege of having a platform to give audiences a glimpse into that feeling.”\r\n\r\nSpecial guests ExMag & Marcelo Moxy kick things off, with more special guests to be announced soon. Tickets go on sale Friday September 5th at 10am MDT via Live Nation and early birds will be able to buy them for only $10 for a limited time!","artists":[{"id":1023486,"name":"Michal
