four decades ago, Elvis Costello released his extraordinary debut album, My Aim Is True, which comprised songs that would become rock-and-roll staples, including \"Alison,\" \"(The Angels Want to Wear My) Red Shoes\" and \"Less Than Zero.\" Since then, Costello has released two dozen studio albums under his own name or with his groups the Attractions and the Imposters, in addition to collaborations like 2013's Wise Up Ghost, a team effort with the Roots. While it's great to see Costello perform fueled-up rock with a full band, seeing the legend solo -- as he'll be tonight at the Paramount Theatre -- should be sublime.","artists":[{"id":2454,"name":"Elvis

rocker Elvis Costello and his band, The Imposters, are hitting the road on their acclaimed \"Imperial Bedroom & Other Chambers\" tour and are coming to Chicago's Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island. For this concert, Costello and Co. have breathed fresh life into one of Costello's best works, the 1982 album \"Imperial Bedroom\". With songs like \"Beyond Belief,\" \"Almost Blue,\" \"Shabby Doll,\" \"Tears Before Bedtime\" and \"Man Out of Time,\" the album was ranked by \"Rolling Stone\" as one of the greatest of all time. While many of the songs have remained staples of Costello's sets over the years, the singer says these revitalized arrangements get \"straight to the real meaning\" of the tunes. And, since it's Costello, you can expect plenty of surprises throughout the night.","artists":[{"id":2454,"name":"Elvis
