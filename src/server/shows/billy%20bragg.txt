his journey through American folklore, legendary British political songwriter Billy Bragg reunites on stage with Grammy Award-winner Joe Henry for a celebration of the great American railroad, the songs it inspired, and some favourites from their own classic catalogues.\n\nHaving first collaborated on Bragg's rustic Tooth & Nail album three years ago, veteran Americana producer Joe Henry (Elvis Costello, Bonnie Raitt) joined the political folk poet in 2016 on a 2,728 mile road trip through the tracks, pit-stops and people that join Chicago's Union Station to Los Angeles. Recorded on that journey, Shine a Light is a musical love-letter to the songs and socio-political climate that inspired the likes of Leadbelly, Hank Williams and Robert Johnson. In the words of Bragg himself, 'the railroad is one of those phrases like 'the west' that has an immediate and evocative sense of space and light, distance and hope, and fear'.\n\nNow bringing the blueprint of modern folk to the fore alongside their own songbooks, Billy Bragg and Joe Henry return to the Concert Hall for a rousing ride through the possibilities of the railroad, and its undeniable stamp on their lives and music.\n\n[Cover photo by Jacob Blickenstaff]","artists":[{"id":4221,"name":"Billy

titel van Billy Bragg’s nieuwe tournee Bridges Not Walls zegt het helemaal: de zanger die we kennen van protestsongs als A New England, The Man With The Iron Mask en Which Side Are You On is nog niks van zijn vuur en engagement verloren. Billy Bragg haalde de inspiratie voor zijn bevlogen folknummers bij de punk van The Clash en het gedreven sociaal gevoel van zangers als Bob Dylan en Woodie Guthrie. Tijdens de jaren 80 was hij in Engeland een van de meest actieve stemmen tegen het regime van Thatcher, en ook vandaag nog staat hij als zanger én politiek activist mee op de Britse barricades. Hij maakte deel uit de Occupybeweging, nam deel aan antiregeringsprotesten in Australië, steunde Schotland in haar strijd om onafhankelijkheid en hield een sterke toespraak op het Glastonburyfestival waarin hij jonge Britten opriep om na de Brexit-uitslag niet te vervallen in cynisme, maar te blijven vechten voor een betere toekomst. We kijken al uit naar zijn concert!","artists":[{"id":4221,"name":"Billy
