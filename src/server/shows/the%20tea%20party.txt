The band made a promise to the fans each night that they would return with new music and they are about to make good on this promise commencing recording sessions - in Australia - in March.\r\n\r\nWhile the band is bunkered down in the studio making new magic, they are going to resurface for special one off shows in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. And take that energy back into the sessions.\r\n\r\nTheir shows in 2012 sold out well in advance so fans are encouraged to not delay or risk missing out once again!\r\n\r\nThe shows will differ from the 2012 concert and will be mainly an a acoustic performance. The band has not done a full show like this in Australia ever before. These special shows will recapture the unique \"Moroccan Roll\" of the band's sound that have made the Canadian band of Australia's all time favourite bands of the 90's and beyond.\r\n","artists":[{"id":20999,"name":"The Tea Party","mbid":"7ebc552b-71b2-47b7-9dc8-31ef08e20aec","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8236028.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8236028.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheTeaParty/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theteapartyofficial","tracker_count":34300,"url":"TheTeaParty","website":"http://www.teaparty.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"The Factory Theatre","place":"The Factory Theatre","city":"Marrickville","region":"Nsw","country":"Australia","latitude":-33.905815,"longitude":151.165301},"ontour_id":"8zWNAeEsx4jstg9eX","genres":["alternative metal","alternative rock","canadian indie","funk rock","grunge","post-grunge","rock"]},{"id":6268052,"artist_id":20999,"artist_event_id":6353961,"title":"The Tea Party @ The HiFi in Melbourne, Australia","datetime":"2013-03-11T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Monday, March 11, 2013 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Melbourne, Australia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/6268052?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Tea+Party&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":20999,"name":"The Tea Party","mbid":"7ebc552b-71b2-47b7-9dc8-31ef08e20aec","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8236028.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8236028.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheTeaParty/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theteapartyofficial","tracker_count":34300,"url":"TheTeaParty","website":"http://www.teaparty.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"The HiFi","place":"The HiFi","city":"Melbourne","region":"07","country":"Australia","latitude":-37.817919,"longitude":144.958088},"ontour_id":"8zWNAeEsx4jstg9eX","genres":["alternative metal","alternative rock","canadian indie","funk rock","grunge","post-grunge","rock"]},{"id":6566049,"artist_id":20999,"artist_event_id":6833460,"title":"The Tea Party @ Niagara River Rocks in North Tonawanda, NY","datetime":"2013-07-14T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, July 14, 2013 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"North Tonawanda, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/6566049?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Tea+Party&came_from=67","description":"Concert is FREE!

1995, Australia truly began its love affair with Canadian trio, The Tea Party – The band’s second album, The Edges of Twilight, became their first top 10 album in the country thanks to the incredible support from the fans, and Triple J championing them\n\nContaining concert staples and fan favourites such as ‘Sister Awake’, ‘The Bazaar’, ‘Fire In The Head’ and ‘Correspondences’, the album was a full realisation of the band’s fusion of eastern instrumentation meeting full-on rock and roll.\n\nFor the first time in Australia, The Tea Party are going to perform the iconic album in its entirety and follow an interval with a second set of hits taken from their first album, Splendor Solis, through to last year’s comeback album The Ocean At The End.\n\nThis will be The Tea Party’s 15th tour of Australia.\n\nThe Edges of Twilight, originally released on March 28, 1995, hit double platinum and was nominated for two Junos in their Native Canada. Perhaps still the most diverse album the band have released, it contains beautiful instrumentals such as ‘The Badger’, peaceful acoustic numbers like ‘Shadows on The Mountainside’, featuring everything from sitar to hurdy-gurdy, through to the relentless onslaught of rock tracks like ‘Coming Home’.\n\nThe three founding members of the band, Jeff Martin, Jeff Burrows and Stuart Chatwood are looking forward to sharing this album with their fans again.\n\nFront man Martin says; “People often ask me ‘what does The Edges of Twilight mean to me as a musician?’ My answer, although not so simple, is simply this: it was the crystallization and the manifestation of an incredible musical vision between the three of us, and the fact that it was achieved in such a way was probably, and is still, one of the proudest musical achievements of my life.”","artists":[{"id":20999,"name":"The Tea
