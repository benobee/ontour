Chandelier Sessions present: An Evening with Giants  ARTIST: We Were Giants, The Beau Motives VENUE: Whelan's (Main Room) DATE: Thursday 24th July DOORS: 7:30pm ADMISSION: FREE  Chandelier Sessions: https://www.facebook.com/ThePinkChandelier  The Chandelier Sessions is an open mic night run every second Thursday in The Old Boro, Swords.   The aim of The Chandelier Sessions is to build a community and provide a platform for musicians to showcase their work, be it music or poetry.  The sessions have seen some of Ireland's top young artists grace the stage including Kodaline and friends Orla Gartland, Gavin James and Hudson Taylor as well as home-grown locals Haleigh Davidson, Rachel Hickey & Alex Smyth.  They continue to source local music and grow a strong community of musicians and followers who have a similar interest in showcasing what this country has to offer.  On Thursday 24th July, the Chandelier Sessions will host a double header event with We Were Giants and The Beau Motives sharing the bill. Admission into the show will be free and promises to be a great night.   We Were Giants: https://www.facebook.com/WWGMusic  Currently in the processing of recording their debut album, We Were Giants are Colm (Vocals/Guitar), Ste (Guitar/Vocals), Danny (Bass) and Jay (Drums). This four piece alternative rock band formed in 2012 after the secession of Colm and Ste's band Blue Syndrome, who prior to splitting were signed to Blastbeat Records.  Their first EP, 'part one' was recorded, mixed and mastered in their kitchen. Their influences are anything loud and probably hairy, Stevie Wonder too.  They recently released the video to their song 'Hey You' which was filmed by The Chandelier Sessions crew themselves and Anchor House Media.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUtfsbIvGbc    The Beau Motives: https://www.facebook.com/TheBeauMotives  The Beau Motives are a 3 piece band from Ireland, They consist of Shaz (Vocals), Stuart (Guitar/Synth) and Jay (Drums/Synth). They formed in 2012 with a common desire to be uncompromising in the quality of their music & performances.  Not wishing to grow beards and play folk music they set about writing and recording their first album at their own studio in Co Meath (Jealoustown Studios), the result of which has been described as having the creative song writing of Kate Bush, the soaring vocals of the Cocteau Twins & the stadium attitude of Muse. The Beau Motives have produced an album, 'Beaneath this sun' that is unique in their own sound and look forward to the world hearing it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2tcN3WpRNI ","artists":[{"id":1575351,"name":"We Were Giants","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7174909.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7174909.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/WeWereGiants/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/We%20Were%20Giants/614226668597262","tracker_count":3726,"url":"WeWereGiants","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Whelan's","place":"Whelan's","city":"Dublin","region":"County Dublin","country":"Ireland","latitude":53.3366203,"longitude":-6.2657499},"ontour_id":"AMk6tbgnc82Kp6gJA","genres":[]},{"id":8612206,"artist_id":1575351,"artist_event_id":10078444,"title":"We Were Giants @ Danny Byrnes Garden Festival in Mullingar, Ireland","datetime":"2014-08-24T14:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 2:00PM","formatted_location":"Mullingar, Ireland","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/8612206?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=We+Were+Giants&came_from=67","description":"Danny Byrnes Final Garden Festival of 2014","artists":[{"id":1575351,"name":"We Were Giants","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7174909.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7174909.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/WeWereGiants/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/We%20Were%20Giants/614226668597262","tracker_count":3726,"url":"WeWereGiants","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Danny Byrnes Garden Festival","place":"Danny Byrnes","city":"Mullingar","region":"County Westmeath","country":"Ireland","latitude":53.52579,"longitude":-7.3404},"ontour_id":"AMk6tbgnc82Kp6gJA","genres":[]},{"id":8654119,"artist_id":1575351,"artist_event_id":10149930,"title":"We Were Giants @ Danny Byrnes in Mullingar, Ireland","datetime":"2014-09-12T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, September 12, 2014 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Mullingar, Ireland","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/8654119?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=We+Were+Giants&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":1575351,"name":"We Were Giants","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7174909.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7174909.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/WeWereGiants/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/We%20Were%20Giants/614226668597262","tracker_count":3726,"url":"WeWereGiants","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Danny Byrnes","place":"Danny Byrnes","city":"Mullingar","region":"County Westmeath","country":"Ireland","latitude":53.52579,"longitude":-7.3404},"ontour_id":"AMk6tbgnc82Kp6gJA","genres":[]},{"id":8693398,"artist_id":1575351,"artist_event_id":10204837,"title":"We Were Giants @ Voodoo Lounge in Dublin, Ireland","datetime":"2014-10-10T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, October 10, 2014 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Dublin, Ireland","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/8693398?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=We+Were+Giants&came_from=67","description":"About This is a fundraising night for Chernobyl Children International.

Drawing heavily from genres outside their rock foundations, the sound of Harbouring Oceans is characterised by close harmony, deep rhythmic grooves and soulful vocal melodies. Hip-hop and electronica are also strong features in the band’s sonic signature. This dynamic sound ranges from quiet, almost ambient territory to squalls of thunderous noise! Harbouring Oceans are due to release their debut single, \"Enso,\" in April 2016, the first release from a band who's members have been playing together in different projects for over a decade. \n\nwww.harbouringoceans.com\nwww.facebook.com/harbouringoceans\n\nWe Were Giants:\n\nWe Were Giants are a Dublin band quoted as a ‘sky-scraping indie rock band with an anthemic touch’. \nMade up of brothers Colm and Stephen O’Loughlin with close friends Danny Farrelly and Jason Maleney, We Were Giants have a huge sound that swells from tenderly soft to bone-crushingly loud. The band have been working with acclaimed Scottish producer Tony Doogan (Belle and Sebastian, Mogwai) with new tracks set for release in the new year. We Were Giants completed a tour of Germany which included a headline slot on the white stage at the Dithmarscher Rockfestival in Marne. \nOther international trade for the band has come in the form of performances at the FOCUS Wales Festival as well as shows in London and Glasgow.\n\nwww.facebook.com/WWGMusic\n\nVernon Jane:\n\nThe energetic and very expressive Vernon Jane are a collection of eclectic and talented musicians. Vernon Jane pull in aspects from multiple influences such as jazz and the psychedelic, their no boundaries approach has paved the way for Vernon Jane to travel the lesser known path into the Irish Music Scene. The band have toured extensively throughout Ireland and have caught the eyes and ears of industry folk. Now included in some of the biggest festivals (Electric Picnic & KnockanStockan) the band are broadening their reach and attracting new fans along the way!\n\nwww.facebook.com/Vernon-Jane-1381442958777943\nhttps://vernonjane.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nFarah Elle:\n\nFarah Elle is a solo artist with an alternative pop sound influenced by an eclectic taste of genres; from hiphop to R&B and ska, while featuring Arabian echoes from her Libyan background. She is currently based in Dublin, having moved to Ireland with her family when she was 2. Her rhythmic lyrics, piano driven songs and distinctive voice aim to reveal something of the beauty in the ephemeral everyday. She is currently writing and recording her debut album at home - For the meantime, her single “Silk” is available on Spotify, iTunes & Soundcloud.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/farahellemusic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-roHuRKLx60","artists":[{"id":1575351,"name":"We Were
