Beaumont has quietly developed a respectable music scene over the past few years, thanks in no small part to the not-so-quiet band Purple. The young trio throws down a catchy and fun brand of big-guitar Technicolor rock that adds a neat little twist or two, like some pretty dope rapping skills (their cover of Devin the Dude’s “What a Job” kills). Purple has steadily been winning fans across the Gulf Coast since at least 2014’s 409, but when songs from latest LP Bodacious began circulating ahead of its April Fools’ Day release, suddenly their circle of admirers got a lot bigger.  Alternative Press recently premiered the “Pretty Mouth” video on its Web site, while NPR’s All Songs Considered declared, “We would follow Purple to the ends of the Earth” during the trio’s recent SXSW blitz. It’s not hard to see why.","artists":[{"id":81948,"name":"Purple","mbid":"6ea57331-4519-4936-a19c-4865fcddc9c3","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6062702.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6062702.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Purple/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/purpletexasmusic","tracker_count":10834,"url":"Purple","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Satellite","place":"Satellite","city":"Houston","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":29.7358283,"longitude":-95.3035265},"ontour_id":"bdopk9r22rTYbimKr","genres":["album rock","alternative rock","art rock","blues-rock","british blues","classic funk rock","classic rock","electric blues","funk rock","hard rock","mellow gold","metal","psychedelic rock","rock","soft rock","southern rock","symphonic rock"]},{"id":11648493,"artist_id":81948,"artist_event_id":14699135,"title":"Purple @ Swan Dive in Austin, TX","datetime":"2016-04-16T21:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, April 16, 2016 at 9:30PM","formatted_location":"Austin, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11648493?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Purple&came_from=67","description":"Purple's Album Release PARTY is SAT 4/16 at Swan Dive yall!
