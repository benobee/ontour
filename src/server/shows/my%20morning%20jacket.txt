rock vets 10 years past their creative prime (2005's Z), My Morning Jacket are a constantly evolving attempt to find further revelation in the soaring voice of Jim James, providing canvasses of all shapes and sizes for his vocal paintbrush to fill in. This year's The Waterfall approximates their best work -- for stretches, anyway -- and that's all a legacy act really needs to keep the juices flowing on tour. Album-opener \"Believe\" is designed for festivals and stage lights, a one-word command/plea that lets audiences fill in the blanks with whatever variation of vaguely defined spirituality their hearts desire. I'd expect to hear it loud and proud, combining with the similarly nonliterary \"Wordless Chorus\" to bring Verizon Theatre a hipper-than-usual crowd. If you're into songs where the words actually matter, Fruit Bats are the opening act, and they've gotten better with age on their increasingly ruminative recent albums. If nothing else, it's a nice change of pace for a venue that mostly plays host to bands like Phish, Hank Williams, Jr. and Don Henley.Brian Peterson","artists":[{"id":977,"name":"My Morning
