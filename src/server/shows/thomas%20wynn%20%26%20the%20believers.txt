The band immediately clicked and was asked to play a Jimi Hendrix tribute show. The show was a huge success and word of mouth quickly spread about this group around Charleston, SC. In August of 2012, Dead 27s recorded and released a 2 song single, which included 2013 Charleston City Paper Music Award \"Song of the Year\" and 2013 Best of Charleston winner, \"Don't Want to Live My Life Without You\". Dead 27s also won, \"Rock Band of the Year\", \"Up and Coming Artist of the Year\" and guitarist Mullinax won \"Guitarist of the Year\". Mullinax has also shared the stage with Leftover Salmon's Vince Herman, Everyone Orchestra, and many others. Dead 27s' sound is described as a Southern blend of rock and soul.\r\nOver the past year, this Charleston super-group has opened for the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, Orgone, Sol Driven Train, Col. Bruce Hampton, Dark Star Orchestra, Toubab Krewe, Patterson Hood, among others. Dead 27s seven-song critically acclaimed debut, \"Chase Your Devils Down\", was released in April 2014. In June 2014, Dead 27s placed in the top 24 for Vh1's You Oughtta Know Artist' Make a Band Famous competition.\r\nhttp://www.dead27s.com/\r\nwww.reverbnation.com/dead27s","artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE

Entry costs $21 per person and includes food, music and a drink ~~chose beer, wine or housemade Chatham Artillery Punch on draft. Service will run from 1pm-4pm with music starting at 2pm. Admittance is first come- first served. Additional information will be available on both The Grey and  Savannah Stopover Facebook pages.\n\nMusic will focus on both emerging and established acts from the region and around the country who will be ‘stopping over’ in Savannah. Savannah Stopover founder Kayne Lanahan added, “We loved the idea from day one. I think it will be fun to showcase a broad range of musical genres in a casual, afternoon setting that gives both locals and visitors a chance to experience The Grey in a whole new way”.\n\nJohno Morisano, owner of The Grey and an avid music lover added, “The Grey is about Savannah and The Yard embodies this in its total communal nature.  What better way to make people happy than by offering some tasty food, affordable drinks and high quality music? As a fan, I am looking forward to this.”\n\n http://www.thegreyrestaurant.com/  ","artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE

Blackberry Smoke has performed with acts such as Zac Brown Band and ZZ Top, among several other national recording artists in the country, rock and blues genres.\n\nHarvest Fest will be the first event to feature live music on the new outdoor stage in Tuscawilla Park, 899 N.E. Sanchez Ave., adjacent to the Reilly Arts Center. A secondary stage nearby will also host artists’ performances. The event will feature live music all day, plus more than 10 food trucks and a craft beer garden provided by Tri Eagle Sales.\n\nUp-and-coming indie recording artists Thomas Wynn and the Believers and Gringo Star are also among national acts that will be playing at the festival. Ocala’s own Travis Knight will also be making an appearance. \n\nIndividual band show times are still to be determined. \nThe full lineup is as follows:\n•Blackberry Smoke (see press photo attached)\n•Evan Taylor Jones Band\n•Beebs and Her Money Makers\n•Gringo Star\n•The Trip (featuring members of Seretonic)\n•Thomas Wynn and the Believers\n•Travis Knight\n•Greymarket\n\n“This is truly a festival for music lovers. I am ecstatic about our headliner and the entire lineup. I can’t think of a better group of musicians to help us celebrate fall, family and the arts in downtown Ocala,” said Janie Pope, communications manager for the city and coordinator of the event. “Bring your blanket and your appetite. You’ll want to sample food and hang out in the park all day long.”\n\nThe City has partnered with Project Hope and JVC Broadcasting again this year to collect food for local families in need prior to the Thanksgiving holiday. Admission to the festival is completely free with a donation of a canned good or non-perishable food item. VIP tickets are also available for $40.00 and will include up-close access to both stages, separate restroom access, one free drink and a free Harvest Fest t-shirt. Other major contributing sponsors include Angie Lewis State Farm and Insight Credit Union.\n\nhttp://www.feeldowntownocala.com/harvestfest-2015/\nhttps://twitter.com/feeldowntown\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1489740671343773/ ","artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8452162.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8452162.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thomaswynnandthebelievers","tracker_count":4386,"url":"ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers","website":null},{"id":5530,"name":"Blackberry Smoke","mbid":"1576a26e-f77d-47ac-87f2-4f610c141ac6","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BlackberrySmoke/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/BlackberrySmoke","tracker_count":140884,"url":"BlackberrySmoke","website":"http://blackberrysmoke.com"}],"venue":{"name":"HarvestFest 2015 Ocala","place":"Downtown Ocala","city":"Ocala","region":"FL","country":"United States","latitude":29.185111,"longitude":-82.134208},"ontour_id":"6QQbbwwQfNFLHkjwf","genres":[]},{"id":10516547,"artist_id":1139968,"artist_event_id":12914345,"title":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS @ Rock The Yacht @Yacht StarShip in Tampa, FL","datetime":"2015-11-14T21:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, November 14, 2015 at 9:00PM","formatted_location":"Tampa, FL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/10516547?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=THOMAS+WYNN+%26+THE+BELIEVERS&came_from=67","description":"Brokenmold Entertainment presents: LIVE MUSIC PARTY CRUISES!

Then watch on Saturday morning, September 10th, The Big Orange Throwdown Competition at Sheraton Four Points lawn/Tiki Bar. You can also participate in the Big Orange OM Zone, a unique Yoga experience. \n\n The culmination of the entire weekend will take place at the Charlotte Harbor Event and Conference Center. This will feature 5 bands, 2 stages, food trucks, and more. The headliner is international recording artists, JJ Grey and Mofro. If you like Southern, Soul, Blues, Rock, and Country, then you will no doubt fall in love with these guys! We also have The Fritz from Asheville North Carolina, Nick Moss Band from Chicago, Thomas Wynn and The Believers from Orlando, Colin Lake from New Orleans, and Still Friends.\n\n The Big Orange Music Festival is going to be a city wide event that has something for everyone! Stay for the weekend and get the full Big Orange experience.\n\nThe Big Orange Music Festival is about community in every sense of the word. This concert all started from the idea of creating an event that would take place in the Downtown district of Punta Gorda, Fl. The reason for doing this is to promote the commerce of our great town! Along with bringing out of towners and locals to the heart of Downtown Punta Gorda, we also work very closely with local charities. \n\n\n\n","artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8452162.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8452162.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thomaswynnandthebelievers","tracker_count":4386,"url":"ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers","website":null},{"id":4391,"name":"JJ GREY and MOFRO","mbid":"a058e7a8-c685-4fb3-b051-b2e5c2c99681","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JjGreyAndMofro/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/MOFROBAND","tracker_count":82299,"url":"JjGreyAndMofro","website":""},{"id":762167,"name":"The Fritz","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheFritz/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theFRITZmusic","tracker_count":5058,"url":"TheFritz","website":null},{"id":8971831,"name":"Nick Moss Band","mbid":"4375399e-c0e2-4038-9920-a6d5120f1ee3","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/NickMossBand/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/nickmossmusic","tracker_count":5266,"url":"NickMossBand","website":""},{"id":11752313,"name":"Colin Lake","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ColinLake/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Colin%20Lake%20Music/117297938357908","tracker_count":1152,"url":"ColinLake","website":""}],"venue":{"name":"The Big Orange Music Festival","place":"Downtown Punta Gorda","city":"Punta Gorda","region":"FL","country":"United States","latitude":26.9367881,"longitude":-82.0527857},"ontour_id":"6QQbbwwQfNFLHkjwf","genres":[]},{"id":13167227,"artist_id":1139968,"artist_event_id":16547359,"title":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS @ Antemesaris RocknRoll Peoples Party in Brooksville, FL","datetime":"2016-11-19T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Brooksville, FL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13167227?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=THOMAS+WYNN+%26+THE+BELIEVERS&came_from=67","description":"November 18-19-20 our very own Chris Bell Antemasaris RocknRoll People's Party #27 at Sertoma Youth Ranch (Brooksville, FL) . . . camp all weekend for $80, with indoor bathrooms and hot showers included! just a 75-min drive west from downtown Orlando . . . killer lineup with Central Florida's favorites!!

Doors Down + Thomas Wynn and The Believers!!!  epic old-school rocknroll!\n\nSince forming in 1995, Mississippi rock quintet 3 Doors Down has sold more than 16 million albums worldwide, received three Grammy nominations, and won two American Music Awards, and five BMI Pop Awards for songwriting—including “Songwriter of the Year.” Their debut The Better Life, became certified six-times RIAA platinum in 2000 and was fueled by the success of juggernaut hit “Kryptonite.” This was followed by 2002’s sophomore album, Away from the Sun which went triple-platinum and saw similar success with “When I’m Gone” and “Here Without You.” 2005’s platinum Seventeen Days and 2008’s 3 Doors Down each earned #1 debuts on the Billboard Top 200, while Time of My Life landed at #3 in 2011. In 2004, the group founded the charity The Better Life Foundation. Ignited by the single “In The Dark,” 3 Doors Down unleashed their sixth full-length album, Us and the Night, in 2016.","artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8452162.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8452162.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thomaswynnandthebelievers","tracker_count":4386,"url":"ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"3 Doors Down + TWTB!","place":"Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre","city":"Atlanta","region":"GA","country":"United States","latitude":33.8844269,"longitude":-84.4583631},"ontour_id":"6QQbbwwQfNFLHkjwf","genres":[]},{"id":14916335,"artist_id":1139968,"artist_event_id":19005827,"title":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS @ Park Tavern in Atlanta, GA","datetime":"2017-08-13T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, August 13, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Atlanta, GA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14916335?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=THOMAS+WYNN+%26+THE+BELIEVERS&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8452162.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8452162.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thomaswynnandthebelievers","tracker_count":4386,"url":"ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Park Tavern","place":"Park Tavern","city":"Atlanta","region":"GA","country":"United States","latitude":33.781911,"longitude":-84.371084},"ontour_id":"6QQbbwwQfNFLHkjwf","genres":[]},{"id":14928403,"artist_id":1139968,"artist_event_id":19023145,"title":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS @ Radio Room in Greenville, SC","datetime":"2017-08-18T20:00:01","formatted_datetime":"Friday, August 18, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Greenville, SC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14928403?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=THOMAS+WYNN+%26+THE+BELIEVERS&came_from=67","description":"","artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8452162.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8452162.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thomaswynnandthebelievers","tracker_count":4386,"url":"ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Radio Room","place":"Radio Room","city":"Greenville","region":"SC","country":"United States","latitude":34.886762,"longitude":-82.390264},"ontour_id":"6QQbbwwQfNFLHkjwf","genres":[]},{"id":14916358,"artist_id":1139968,"artist_event_id":19005851,"title":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS @ Jack Rabbit's Live in Jacksonville, FL","datetime":"2017-08-19T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, August 19, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Jacksonville, FL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14916358?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=THOMAS+WYNN+%26+THE+BELIEVERS&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":1139968,"name":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8452162.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8452162.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thomaswynnandthebelievers","tracker_count":4386,"url":"ThomasWynnAndTheBelievers","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Jack Rabbit's Live","place":"Jack Rabbit's Live","city":"Jacksonville","region":"FL","country":"United States","latitude":30.3098354,"longitude":-81.6550217},"ontour_id":"6QQbbwwQfNFLHkjwf","genres":[]},{"id":15298041,"artist_id":1139968,"artist_event_id":19539803,"title":"THOMAS WYNN & THE BELIEVERS @ CANCELLED DUE TO HURRICANE IRMA  in Nashville, TN","datetime":"2017-09-10T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, September 10, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Nashville, TN","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-09-08T16:55:01","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15298041?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=THOMAS+WYNN+%26+THE+BELIEVERS&came_from=67","description":"HAVE to cancel due to Hurricane Irma affecting our home state!
