Haley is breaking out on his own terms.\r\n\r\nConnection, his Easy Star Records debut, is aptly named. It's all about those deep-running connections that make him what he is—those unbreakable links between artist and audience, between styles of music, between art and life, and most of all, between all people. As Cas points out, reggae's core message is, after all, \"one love.\"\r\n\r\nHis crystalline voice and funky, easygoing beats earned Cas a second-place finish on America's Got Talent, which in turn netted him a measure of fame and a following. But the contest also locked the Texan singer/songwriter/guitarist into a major label deal that didn't feel right. So, not wanting to be turned into a manufactured product, he struck out on his own. The superb result: Connection, a collection of songs basking in the philosophical and musical maturity that comes from staying true to his artistic vision.\r\n\r\nRaised by musician parents, Cas grew up surrounded by the sounds of blues and 60s-70s rock. He got serious about the guitar at age 12 and was \"taught by the tribe\" of musicians passing through the house. \"The kitchen would be turned into the practice room or for jam sessions, so I was pretty much born into that lifestyle,\" he says. And from the very beginning he was more inclined to create his own music than to slavishly learn covers.\r\n\r\nAlso prominent at home were the Bob Marley records his mother would play, which made a profound impression. After a period of heavy immersion in the sounds of the ska/punk/skateboard culture, Cas was blown away by the classic reggae-pop of bands like UB40 and Sublime, and his mature style began to take shape.\r\n\r\nThose pop-inflected island grooves and his joyful, versatile voice helped bring Cas to the brink of stardom on America's Got Talent and sell 30,000 copies of a debut album with virtually no promotion. And they're fundamental to the soul of his music—what he calls the \"relaxing, effortless playing where everything fits together.\" Elements of soul, blues, and pop swirl through Cas's strong reggae beats. Just like disparate musical styles, \"we're way more connected than we think,\" Cas says. \"We separate ourselves in so many different ways, but the whole theme of the album is that we're all connected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every color,\" he sings in the title track, \"is created from the same light.\" \r\n\r\nEasy Star, the leading U.S.-based independent reggae label, is the ideal home for Connection. The label has been stretching beyond its strictly roots-reggae format, signing progressive bands and artists like John Brown’s Body, Tommy T, and The Black Seeds. “Cas’s sound is unique, accessible, and a great way to keep expanding the Easy Star audience,\" says CEO Eric Smith. \"And it’s not often we come across a singer-songwriter this talented, regardless of genre, so we had to work with Cas.”\r\n\r\nMixed by Danny Kalb (Ben Harper, Beck), Connection bristles with chill grooves, rocking guitars, and funky horns, all fueling Cas's irresistible melodies. Meanwhile his lyrics effortlessly balance simple, spiritual truths with thoughtful reflection. Cas's songs recognize the complexities of life—love, family, worldly troubles and uncertainties—but always come back to the central message of connection. \r\n\r\nIt's the journey that matters; Cas is aiming for success on his own terms. \"If I'm not doing it authentically then I don't want it,\" he says. His only goal: \"To authentically express myself and help others do the same. Because it's a sweet life to be able to do that.\"","artists":[{"id":161579,"name":"Cas Haley","mbid":"06771314-6ee5-4f97-80dd-c01a6c007c7b","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8220839.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8220839.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CasHaley/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/haley.cas","tracker_count":23392,"url":"CasHaley","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"The Capitol","place":"The Capitol","city":"Houston","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":29.759066,"longitude":-95.363234},"ontour_id":"DHPtEwBvdsvJwjyi2","genres":["reggae rock"]},{"id":4870222,"artist_id":161579,"artist_event_id":4133414,"title":"Cas Haley @ The Granada Theater w/ Javier Colon in Dallas, TX","datetime":"2012-02-22T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, February 22, 2012 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Dallas, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/4870222?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cas+Haley&came_from=67","description":"Cas Haley is breaking out on his own terms.\r\n\r\nConnection, his Easy Star Records debut, is aptly named.

Haley is breaking out on his own terms.\r\n\r\nConnection, his Easy Star Records debut, is aptly named. It's all about those deep-running connections that make him what he is—those unbreakable links between artist and audience, between styles of music, between art and life, and most of all, between all people. As Cas points out, reggae's core message is, after all, \"one love.\"\r\n\r\nHis crystalline voice and funky, easygoing beats earned Cas a second-place finish on America's Got Talent, which in turn netted him a measure of fame and a following. But the contest also locked the Texan singer/songwriter/guitarist into a major label deal that didn't feel right. So, not wanting to be turned into a manufactured product, he struck out on his own. The superb result: Connection, a collection of songs basking in the philosophical and musical maturity that comes from staying true to his artistic vision.\r\n\r\nRaised by musician parents, Cas grew up surrounded by the sounds of blues and 60s-70s rock. He got serious about the guitar at age 12 and was \"taught by the tribe\" of musicians passing through the house. \"The kitchen would be turned into the practice room or for jam sessions, so I was pretty much born into that lifestyle,\" he says. And from the very beginning he was more inclined to create his own music than to slavishly learn covers.\r\n\r\nAlso prominent at home were the Bob Marley records his mother would play, which made a profound impression. After a period of heavy immersion in the sounds of the ska/punk/skateboard culture, Cas was blown away by the classic reggae-pop of bands like UB40 and Sublime, and his mature style began to take shape.\r\n\r\nThose pop-inflected island grooves and his joyful, versatile voice helped bring Cas to the brink of stardom on America's Got Talent and sell 30,000 copies of a debut album with virtually no promotion. And they're fundamental to the soul of his music—what he calls the \"relaxing, effortless playing where everything fits together.\" Elements of soul, blues, and pop swirl through Cas's strong reggae beats. Just like disparate musical styles, \"we're way more connected than we think,\" Cas says. \"We separate ourselves in so many different ways, but the whole theme of the album is that we're all connected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every color,\" he sings in the title track, \"is created from the same light.\" \r\n\r\nEasy Star, the leading U.S.-based independent reggae label, is the ideal home for Connection. The label has been stretching beyond its strictly roots-reggae format, signing progressive bands and artists like John Brown’s Body, Tommy T, and The Black Seeds. “Cas’s sound is unique, accessible, and a great way to keep expanding the Easy Star audience,\" says CEO Eric Smith. \"And it’s not often we come across a singer-songwriter this talented, regardless of genre, so we had to work with Cas.”\r\n\r\nMixed by Danny Kalb (Ben Harper, Beck), Connection bristles with chill grooves, rocking guitars, and funky horns, all fueling Cas's irresistible melodies. Meanwhile his lyrics effortlessly balance simple, spiritual truths with thoughtful reflection. Cas's songs recognize the complexities of life—love, family, worldly troubles and uncertainties—but always come back to the central message of connection. \r\n\r\nIt's the journey that matters; Cas is aiming for success on his own terms. \"If I'm not doing it authentically then I don't want it,\" he says. His only goal: \"To authentically express myself and help others do the same. Because it's a sweet life to be able to do that.\"","artists":[{"id":161579,"name":"Cas Haley","mbid":"06771314-6ee5-4f97-80dd-c01a6c007c7b","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8220839.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8220839.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CasHaley/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/haley.cas","tracker_count":23392,"url":"CasHaley","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Austin Reggae Festival 4/18/14","place":"Austin Reggae Festival 4/18/14","city":"Austin","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":30.2669444,"longitude":-97.7427778},"ontour_id":"DHPtEwBvdsvJwjyi2","genres":["reggae rock"]},{"id":5245240,"artist_id":161579,"artist_event_id":4697162,"title":"Cas Haley @ Stratton Mountain in Stratton, VT","datetime":"2012-05-27T14:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, May 27, 2012 at 2:30PM","formatted_location":"Stratton, VT","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/5245240?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cas+Haley&came_from=67","description":"$15 tickets\r\nAll ages\r\n100% of ticket sales benefit the Stratton Foundation\r\nDoors at 2:30 PM, show at 4 PM\r\nWith Trevor Hall, Justin Young","artists":[{"id":161579,"name":"Cas Haley","mbid":"06771314-6ee5-4f97-80dd-c01a6c007c7b","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8220839.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8220839.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CasHaley/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/haley.cas","tracker_count":23392,"url":"CasHaley","website":null},{"id":2729852,"name":"Cas Haley with Trevor Hall & Justin Young","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CasHaleyWithTrevorHallAndJustinYoung/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"CasHaleyWithTrevorHallAndJustinYoung","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Stratton Mountain","place":"Stratton Mountain","city":"Stratton","region":"VT","country":"United States","latitude":43.114007,"longitude":-72.90506},"ontour_id":"DHPtEwBvdsvJwjyi2","genres":["reggae rock"]},{"id":5172592,"artist_id":161579,"artist_event_id":4577231,"title":"Cas Haley @ Barefoot at the Belmont in Dallas, TX","datetime":"2012-05-31T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, May 31, 2012 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Dallas, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/5172592?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cas+Haley&came_from=67","description":"HEADLINER - Connection, his Easy Star Records debut, is aptly named.

He got serious about the guitar at age 12 and was \"taught by the tribe\" of musicians passing through the house. \"The kitchen would be turned into the practice room or for jam sessions, so I was pretty much born into that lifestyle,\" he says. And from the very beginning he was more inclined to create his own music than to slavishly learn covers.\r\n\r\nAlso prominent at home were the Bob Marley records his mother would play, which made a profound impression. After a period of heavy immersion in the sounds of the ska/punk/skateboard culture, Cas was blown away by the classic reggae-pop of bands like UB40 and Sublime, and his mature style began to take shape.\r\n\r\nThose pop-inflected island grooves and his joyful, versatile voice helped bring Cas to the brink of stardom on America's Got Talent and sell 30,000 copies of a debut album with virtually no promotion. And they're fundamental to the soul of his music—what he calls the \"relaxing, effortless playing where everything fits together.\" Elements of soul, blues, and pop swirl through Cas's strong reggae beats. Just like disparate musical styles, \"we're way more connected than we think,\" Cas says. \"We separate ourselves in so many different ways, but the whole theme of the album is that we're all connected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every color,\" he sings in the title track, \"is created from the same light.\" \r\n\r\nEasy Star, the leading U.S.-based independent reggae label, is the ideal home for Connection. The label has been stretching beyond its strictly roots-reggae format, signing progressive bands and artists like John Brown’s Body, Tommy T, and The Black Seeds. “Cas’s sound is unique, accessible, and a great way to keep expanding the Easy Star audience,\" says CEO Eric Smith. \"And it’s not often we come across a singer-songwriter this talented, regardless of genre, so we had to work with Cas.”\r\n\r\nMixed by Danny Kalb (Ben Harper, Beck), Connection bristles with chill grooves, rocking guitars, and funky horns, all fueling Cas's irresistible melodies. Meanwhile his lyrics effortlessly balance simple, spiritual truths with thoughtful reflection. Cas's songs recognize the complexities of life—love, family, worldly troubles and uncertainties—but always come back to the central message of connection. \r\n\r\nIt's the journey that matters; Cas is aiming for success on his own terms. \"If I'm not doing it authentically then I don't want it,\" he says. His only goal: \"To authentically express myself and help others do the same. Because it's a sweet life to be able to do that.\"","artists":[{"id":161579,"name":"Cas Haley","mbid":"06771314-6ee5-4f97-80dd-c01a6c007c7b","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8220839.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8220839.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CasHaley/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/haley.cas","tracker_count":23392,"url":"CasHaley","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"The Shed BBQ & Blues Joint","place":"The Shed BBQ & Blues Joint","city":"Mobile","region":"AL","country":"United States","latitude":30.6941667,"longitude":-88.0430556},"ontour_id":"DHPtEwBvdsvJwjyi2","genres":["reggae rock"]},{"id":4974550,"artist_id":161579,"artist_event_id":4283941,"title":"Cas Haley @ The Hangout in Gulf Shores, AL","datetime":"2012-06-03T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, June 3, 2012 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Gulf Shores, AL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/4974550?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cas+Haley&came_from=67","description":"\r\nCas Haley is breaking out on his own terms.\r\n\r\nConnection, his Easy Star Records debut, is aptly named. It's all about those deep-running connections that make him what he is—those unbreakable links between artist and audience, between styles of music, between art and life, and most of all, between all people. As Cas points out, reggae's core message is, after all, \"one love.\"\r\n\r\nHis crystalline voice and funky, easygoing beats earned Cas a second-place finish on America's Got Talent, which in turn netted him a measure of fame and a following.

Haley\n\nOfficial Website: www.cashaley.com\n\nFrom the outside, the soulful musician looks like he has it all: A loving young family, a wonderful home near Paris, Texas, where he grew up, and a career on the rise. He’s shared stages with UB40, Allen Stone, G. Love, Ziggy Marley, and Easy Star All-Stars, among others, and has per- formed at events such as Hangout Music Festival, California Roots Music and Arts Festival, Reggae on the River, and Mighty Sounds in the Czech Republic. But a freak accident — a fall while skiing at a festival in the Midwest — left Haley unable to sing. During eight months of treatment, he had plenty of time to think about what the injury meant to his future.\n\nThe idea for More Music More Family came from reflecting on how to pursue his career more holistically.\n\n“To be alone is an unnatural thing / even when you’re spreading good vibes with the songs you love to sing,” the musician reveals on the title track of his album. Spending months at a time on the road, he was missing his children as they grew up: “In pursuit of this dream, I was creating tension,” he says.\n\nHaley channeled that turmoil into an album’s worth of material. More Music More Family, which will be released through Jimmy Buffett’s label, Mailboat Records, deals with realizing purpose, strength and values. Crowdfunded through a Pledge Music campaign and recorded over a month at Steelgrass Farm in Kauai, Hawaii, the making of the record was as much about the healing process as the creative process. For starters, Haley points out, Hawaii is paradise. If you’re having issues in paradise, they suddenly become very clear.\n\nThose challenges — and the overcoming of them — are felt on More Music More Family, but songs like the blues-tinged and funky “I Got You” and the danceable, kinetic “Spirit Being” ad- dress the universality of life lessons with positivity, uplifting melodies and Haley’s heartfelt vocal style. “Big Hope,” a track whose reggae-flavored intro gives way to energetic hip-hop beats, features Freewill (Luminaries) and Drew Misik (New Reb). Singer/songwriter Trevor Hall guests on “Hold Up My Heart,” up-and-coming Hawaiian artist Mike Love lends an Aloha spirit to the second verse of the title track, and Andrew Terrett, aka Tubby Love, is featured on “Whole.” \n\nTubby Love co-produced More Music More Family, co-writing about 90 percent of the songs with Haley. Their different writing styles — Haley uses a lot of artistic license and relies on emotion and delivery to tell the story; Tubby Love aims for clarity of message and precise lyrics — melded to powerful effect. The album borrows the best of Haley’s previous efforts. Connection, from 2010, was recorded in a controlled studio setting while 2012’s La Si Dah was captured in full takes with no overdubs. On More Music More Family, Haley and his team wanted to bridge those two worlds, capturing an organic feeling along with a high fidelity.\n\nWhile the album nods frequently to reggae sounds and textures, Haley — who grew up with musician parents and their extensive record collection — doesn’t consider himself a reggae artist. His omnivorous listening habits and involvement in the skateboard culture of the early ’90s led him to the ska artists who influence him to this day. But More Music More Family is eclectic: “Man Inside” weaves introspective and honest lyrics through shimmying rhythms and a low-key refrain. Instrumental track “Ryan’s Prayer” is a cool swirl of melody and propulsive beat, and “Before It’s Too Late,” soul-tinged and syncopated, builds a platform from which Haley’s vocal can soar. The gospel break down in that song’s last minute raises the energy even higher with its celebratory stomps, claps and huge-hearted magnetism.\n\nNow recovered and back to making music, Haley’s new approach incorporates his family into shorter tours. He’s also making sure the places he plays are aligned with his family-friendly approach. “I’m trying to make everything more in line with the message so that I can be received in the way that makes the best impact,” he says\nThat message has everything to do with the importance of the unit, which includes blood relatives as well as close friends. Even as people pursue their dreams and careers, Haley hopes they won’t lose sight of togetherness. “Slow down and be aware of the blessing of family,” he says. “That’s where the light comes from.”","artists":[{"id":161579,"name":"Cas
