The Moody Blues will bring their historic Days of Future Passed 50th Anniversary Tour to Encore Theater for four shows in January 2018. But this is not a standard rock concert, it is a uniquely commemorative experience. Played in two parts, the set will include the bands greatest rock hits first, followed by a performance of the whole Days of Future Passed album. Released in 1976, this groundbreaking orchestral rock concept album is perhaps The Moody Blues greatest legacy, and became one of the best selling albums of all time. In this intimate setting, fans will get an up close and personal musical performance by this legendary band, from Nights In White Satin to more timeless rock, classical and pop rock hits that defined The Moody Blues signature sound.","artists":[{"id":45972,"name":"The Moody Blues","mbid":"774666d2-2064-4d6c-856c-f8cda0aaf9f0","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7254539.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7254539.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheMoodyBlues/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/MoodyBlues","tracker_count":103950,"url":"TheMoodyBlues","website":"http://www.moodyblues.co.uk"}],"venue":{"name":"Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas","place":"Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas","city":"Las Vegas","region":"NV","country":"United States","latitude":36.1276013,"longitude":-115.1676835},"ontour_id":"CTko7dXqazAyEyNSx","genres":["album rock","art rock","blues-rock","british blues","british invasion","classic rock","folk","folk rock","hard rock","mellow gold","pop christmas","progressive rock","psychedelic rock","rock","roots rock","singer-songwriter","soft rock","space rock","symphonic rock","traditional folk"]}]
