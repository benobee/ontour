every full-time musician can tell of a serendipitous series of events that led him or her down the path of becoming a professsional. Maybe Mom and Dad had some old records that sparked an interest, or tuba spots in the school band were all taken up, so they had to play drums instead. Michael Deni of Geographer was walking along one day and just happened to find a synthesizer out in the street. Seriously, he found a functioning synthesizer. Then he learned to play it. The gods might as well have had him trip over it, then look at it curiously with a giant question mark floating over his head. The synthesizer inspired Geographer's debut Innocent Ghosts, which is packed with moody synth, catchy hooks, and eerie vocals. Since then, the band has been the focus of media attention — Spin called it \"one of the three undiscovered bands you need to hear now\" — and supported bands like Foster the People, Freelance Whales, Atlas Sound, Local Natives, Surfer Blood, Sea Wolf, and more on tour.","artists":[{"id":182720,"name":"Geographer","mbid":"c1213174-2d79-488d-93fd-1db2ef43da8e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7486950.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7486950.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Geographer/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Geographerfan","tracker_count":51025,"url":"Geographer","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Bluebird

Betty Who’s “Mama Say” combines the throwaway glamour of fast fashion with the poetic verve of the silliest early rock and roll, and the censors should be in every mall, notepads ready. Despite her music conservatory background, her productions are high-gloss and free of pesky, extra notes. Her pizzicatos are icy, but her double-entendres are right out of the Aerosmith chapbook, and her voice is that chimerical mix of thin and throaty best-suited to calling the dogs of summer to heel. Like Kylie Minogue with an updated OS, Betty Who is an icon in the making, another larger-than-life Aussie ready to run the charts.","artists":[{"id":182720,"name":"Geographer","mbid":"c1213174-2d79-488d-93fd-1db2ef43da8e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7486950.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7486950.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Geographer/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Geographerfan","tracker_count":51025,"url":"Geographer","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"White
