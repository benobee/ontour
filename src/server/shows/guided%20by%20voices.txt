reforming in 2010, Guided by Voices released seven albums, including the brand new Please Be Honest. That kind of a output is a life's work for most groups, and that's not counting the Dayton, Ohio, alt-rock band's prolific output since the early 1980s. On top of all that, bandleader Robert Pollard often engages in various side projects under such names as Airport 5, Go Back Snowball and Circus Devils. No matter what he calls himself, Pollard always combines tuneful power-pop melodies with clever lyrics, whether he's reveling in being a big fish in a small pond (\"Littlest League Possible\") or finding salvation in factories (\"Laundry & Lasers\").","artists":[{"id":10180,"name":"Guided by
