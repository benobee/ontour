From SF to NYC, LA to Honolulu. Sao Paolo to Winnipeg, Chicago to Philly and beyond MOM DJs have ignited the dance hall with their hot selection of soul classics, original heavy remixes and genre blending soul edits. On the heels of their first 45rpm release of The Gaff & Featurecast’s Ain’t Got Time / Wishin’ remixes a la Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye MOM DJs presents an all out rump rocking evening featuring DJ set by Cut Chemist (of Jurassic 5 & Ozamatli), live performance and record release by the new 11 piece supergroup Alligator Spacewalk (feat. Ziek McCarter, Aima the Dreamer, members of Jazz Mafia, Solomon Burke, Con Brio) and your MOM DJs Gordo Cabeza, Timoteo Gigante, Phleck, Malachi Padron, and Expo. \n  \n  \n— \n  \nCut Chemist has been recording and performing for over twenty years. He started dj’ing in 1984, at age 11 years old. In 1987 aged 14 Cut started recording with his friends including Chali 2na (Jurassic 5). Cut first became known as a founding member of both the rap group Jurassic 5 and the Grammy award winning Latin funk outfit, Ozomatli. Keeping his involvement with both groups in tandem with one another, Cut has developed a taste for music and rhythms from around the world while keeping his ethic for the hip hop tradition. His mix-tapes and remixes became critically acclaimed. His ‘Chemist’ moniker was fully realized with his instrumental, Lesson 6: The Lecture. A musical journey that challenged hip hop production with music theory ideals. Cut also found time to collaborate with DJ Shadow on what would be one of the worlds most sought after mix cd’s, Brainfreeze, followed by its sequel, Product Placement. \nSound Of The Police proves Cut Chemist is still pushing the envelope when it comes to live DJing. It combines entertainment with music and cultural education. Cuts always used these elements when it comes to his music and he won’t stop. “It’s important to widen peoples musical vocabulary and I feel its my job as a DJ to do so.” While Cut is finishing his sophomore solo LP, Sound Of The Police will tide fans over with unique DJ skills and an eclectic blend of music from around the world. Cut is also moving forward to release a series of reissues through his label A Stable Sound.

Now in its fifth year, and after selling out in 2016, Australia’s leading boutique electronic music festival is set to breeze into 2017 from the heart of the sublime gardens at Werribee Mansion, the shiniest jewel in a very stately crown. Increasingly inspired by function and form, Let Them Eat Cake is a discerning affair, played out within an astute aesthetic. With its carefully constructed feel, abstract architecture and futuristic sound, New Year’s Day 2017 promises not to disappoint, an adventure deep into a utopian imagining of the limbic senses. At its apex, Cake is about an uncompromising attention to detail, a handcrafted lineup of international and local talent, and a surprising palette of food and art. A commentary on design aesthetics paired with an intelligent, minimalist celebration of electronica, Cake has become greater than its parts, each element coalescing to create a spatial dimension that is both lavish and cultivated, ephemeral yet enduring. Like the Buddhist Mandala, its beauty lies in the effort of creation which seemingly surpasses its use of only one perfect day.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Tickets are strictly non refundable - For additional Terms

electronic rock band STS9's meteoric rise to the forefront of the international music scene began nearly 17 years ago in Atlanta, and since that time they've headlined America's most classic theaters, arenas, amphitheatres, and large music festivals. The band consistently lands themselves on \"Pollstar Magazine\"'s top touring charts in the country, with recent average attendance of over 5,000 fans per city on full fledged tours. The band's 11th album, \"When the Dust Settles\", keeps with \"XLR8R Magazine\"'s exclamation that STS9 is \"one of the country's most intriguing, innovative outfits around.\" STS9 is currently touring with their largest production rig ever, using the latest cutting-edge sound and lighting to deliver one of the most audibly and visually stunning shows in all of North America today. Catch them at The Warfield in San Francisco. The New Year's show includes a countdown at midnight.","artists":[{"id":2142,"name":"Cut Chemist","mbid":"e0975164-e68b-45d6-9854-d5d0ce84e671","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8266245.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8266245.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CutChemist/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/CutChemist/","tracker_count":48710,"url":"CutChemist","website":"http://www.cutchemist.com"}],"venue":{"name":"The Warfield","place":"The Warfield","city":"San Francisco","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":37.782606,"longitude":-122.409893},"ontour_id":"ccKjZj5ECbBYTfwdr","genres":["big beat","ninja","nu jazz","trip hop","turntablism"]},{"id":16377543,"artist_id":2142,"artist_event_id":21105954,"title":"Cut Chemist @ Cornerstone in Berkeley, CA","datetime":"2018-03-03T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, March 3, 2018 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Berkeley, CA","ticket_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16377543/buy_tickets?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cut+Chemist&came_from=67","ticket_type":"Tickets","ticket_status":"available","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16377543?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cut+Chemist&came_from=67","description":"","artists":[{"id":2142,"name":"Cut Chemist","mbid":"e0975164-e68b-45d6-9854-d5d0ce84e671","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8266245.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8266245.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CutChemist/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/CutChemist/","tracker_count":48710,"url":"CutChemist","website":"http://www.cutchemist.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Cornerstone","place":"Cornerstone","city":"Berkeley","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":37.866349,"longitude":-122.267195},"ontour_id":"ccKjZj5ECbBYTfwdr","genres":["big beat","ninja","nu jazz","trip hop","turntablism"]},{"id":16377541,"artist_id":2142,"artist_event_id":21105952,"title":"Cut Chemist @ Nectar Lounge in Seattle, WA","datetime":"2018-03-09T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, March 9, 2018 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Seattle, WA","ticket_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16377541/buy_tickets?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cut+Chemist&came_from=67","ticket_type":"Tickets","ticket_status":"available","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16377541?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cut+Chemist&came_from=67","description":"","artists":[{"id":2142,"name":"Cut Chemist","mbid":"e0975164-e68b-45d6-9854-d5d0ce84e671","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8266245.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8266245.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CutChemist/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/CutChemist/","tracker_count":48710,"url":"CutChemist","website":"http://www.cutchemist.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Nectar Lounge","place":"Nectar Lounge","city":"Seattle","region":"WA","country":"United States","latitude":47.652187,"longitude":-122.354151},"ontour_id":"ccKjZj5ECbBYTfwdr","genres":["big beat","ninja","nu jazz","trip hop","turntablism"]}]
