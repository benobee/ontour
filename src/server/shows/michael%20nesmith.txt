Wallach\ndiscussing his upcoming memoir, Infinite Tuesday: An Autobiographical Riff\nTICKETS:$45 General Admission seat + a copy of Infinite Tuesday\nMichael Nesmith's career in music and television took him from starring in The Monkees to a celebrated run of albums as a solo artist and in the First National Band. He created the TV show Popclips, a forerunner of what would become MTV, and produced the films Repo Man and Tapeheads. He is the author of two novels and the founder of the Pacific Arts Corporation, which produces projects in the worlds of audio, video, and virtual reality, including Videoranch 3D.\nThe long, strange journey of Michael Nesmith is as fascinating as it as was fraught--from fleeing Dallas as a young man with his pregnant girlfriend, to gaining international fame as a member of the Monkees, to falling deep into the grips of what he calls Celebrity Psychosis, to finally achieving inner peace and finding a creative wellspring in the teachings of Christian Science. Influenced in equal parts by the consciousness-expanding ambitions of Timothy Leary and the cerebral humor of Douglas Adams, in Infinite Tuesday, Nesmith spins a spellbinding tale of an unexpected life, in which stories about meeting John Lennon, or recording with Nashville greats, or inventing the music video trace an arc from Hollywood to Silicon Valley, illuminating a remarkable mind along the way.\nD.A. Wallach is a recording artist, songwriter, investor, and essayist who Kanye West and Pharrell Williams discovered while he was an undergraduate at Harvard College. He has been featured in GQ, Rolling Stone, Vogue, and numerous other publications, and has toured with N*E*R*D, Lady Gaga, and Weezer. D.A. has also performed on TV Shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\nAs one half of Chester French, D.A. has released three full-length albums, and  has written and performed on records with Janelle Monae, Rick Ross, Diddy, and many others. His solo debut for Capitol Records is Time Machine.\nBeyond music, D.A. invests in and advises several start-up technology companies, including SpaceX, Doctor On Demand, Ripple Labs, DAQRI, and Spotify, where he was the official Artist in Residence. Forbes selected D.A. as one of its 30 Under 30 and Fast Company named him one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business. In 2015, he launched Inevitable Ventures, an investment partnership with multibillionaire Ron Burkle that supports radical entrepreneurs in areas ranging from health care to labor.\nIn 2016, D.A. made his feature film debut in La La Land, which won a record number of Golden Globe Awards and received 14 Academy Award nominations, making it one of the 3 most nominated films in history. He frequently publishes essays on media, technology, and philosophy  on his website and Medium. \n\nTicket sales are final.  No refunds.","artists":[{"id":235803,"name":"Michael Nesmith","mbid":"9c4df1e9-6092-4862-b493-0b72262d91c8","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/210623.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/210623.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MichaelNesmith/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":5643,"url":"MichaelNesmith","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Ann and Jerry Moss Theater at  New Roads School","place":"Ann and Jerry Moss Theater at  New Roads School","city":"Santa Monica","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.031074,"longitude":-118.4611049},"ontour_id":"3fpsysWeKJh8W5gDt","genres":["country rock","folk","folk rock","roots rock","singer-songwriter","traditional folk"]},{"id":14262933,"artist_id":235803,"artist_event_id":18109660,"title":"Michael Nesmith @ Ann and Jerry Moss Theater at  New Roads School in Santa Monica, CA","datetime":"2017-04-28T02:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, April 28, 2017 at 2:00AM","formatted_location":"Santa Monica, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14262933?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Michael+Nesmith&came_from=67","description":"Thursday, April 27, 2017, 8pm. \nMichael Nesmith in conversation with D.A.
