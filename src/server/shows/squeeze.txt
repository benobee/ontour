in 1973 by friends Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, Squeeze went on to become one of the U.K.'s most successful and beloved bands of the '70s and 80s. Their quirky pop-meets-New Wave beats and clever lyricism on tracks like \"Cool for Cats,\" \"Up the Junction\" and \"Another Nail in My Heart\" helped them climb the charts abroad, while soulful singles \"Tempted\" and \"Black Coffee in Bed\" jumped across the pond and earned Squeeze U.S. fans. In 2015, the band released its 15th album, \"Cradle to the Grave\", receiving critical acclaim and proving their hit-making prowess remains in tact. Hear them rip into over 40 years' worth of timeless tracks when they take the stage at Benaroya Hall in Seattle's S.

Dubbed \"the new Lennon and McCartney,\" Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook formed Squeeze in 1970s London, leaving an indelible impression on the UK's music scene. Their masterful album, Cradle to the Grave, marks their 14th studio album and the first since 1998's Domino. To namecheck the first single from Cradle to the Grave, \"Happy Days\" really are here again. Difford and Tilbrook have survived everything over the years, from the ever-changing musical landscape to their own reshuffles and breakups, but are still going strong, still touring and still loving every moment.","artists":[{"id":7515,"name":"Squeeze","mbid":"0509a681-a362-4800-9075-656041dccdbd","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8145609.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8145609.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Squeeze/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/squeezeofficial","tracker_count":78786,"url":"Squeeze","website":"http://www.squeezeofficial.com"}],"venue":{"name":"New

London new-wave legends Squeeze are headed for Australia in 2018 for a run of not-to-be-missed shows. With hits like 'Cool For Cats', 'Tempted' and 'Up The Junction', Squeeze will bring the soundtrack of the 70s and 80s into full focus with special guest punk poet Dr John Cooper Clarke. Squeeze first formed in 1973, brought together by an ad in a sweetshop window. By 1977 they had made their recording debut and enjoyed a string of hits which lasted until 1982, the maturity of their songs outliving their initial burst of chart activity on the back of New Wave.
