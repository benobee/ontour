McHugh has a new album. It is called WAVES as in, vibrations. The vibrations that connect everyone and everything. The waves of energy that we all shimmer in and of. Simple magic.\n\nAnd he is going out on a tour of the same name.\n\nAs with his last solo effort Love Come Save Me, Mat is going to be giving WAVES away as a free digital download so that people can hear and share the music around the World.\n\nThe first song to be made available from WAVES is SIDEWAYS - a mix of confessional lyrics, acoustic guitars, driving dub influenced rhythms and melodic lines synthesized by Mat sampling his voice and other assorted items he had lying around the studio.\n\nThe song is available as an immediate free download from WWW.WAVESTHEALBUM.COM\n\n\"WAVES is inspired by my father, who passed away when I was ten. One of my fondest memories of him is his love for his guitar, an old acoustic that he used to play around the house on a regular basis. When I was cleaning out some things last year, I stumbled upon that exact guitar and decided to see if I could fix it up. I wanted to see if it still had any songs in it. With a bit of tweaking and restringing I was able to bring it back to life, recreating that sound I remember so clearly from my childhood. That guitar is responsible for WAVES - every song was written on it and it made its way onto every track on the album\".\n\nMat has always been an independent artist, self-funding all his own recordings, plus manufacturing, distribution and marketing. He did all the engineering and production on WAVES, as well as playing all of the instruments. His longtime friend and collaborator Ian Pritchett helped with the engineering and did the final mixing.\n\nPeople can start downloading from today and once registered, they will automatically receive an email on the day the rest of WAVES becomes available.\n\nSays Mat of allowing access to the music for free, 'Getting my music out this way allows me to allows me to reach people who might not have heard it before. When someone downloads a song, they share it with their friends, if they like it, and then the cycle continues. I like the idea of the music speaking for itself and, even more, I like the idea of people sharing things. Plus, the act of giving always feels like, to me, a pretty fun thing to be doing.'\n\nFor the tour, Mat will be doing some shows solo and some shows with a full band lineup. The performances will feature songs from WAVES and Love Come Save Me with the occasional gem from Mat's deep catalogue of songs from The Beautiful Girls and Seperatista SoundSystem projects.\n\nDownload SIDEWAYS FREE from WWW.WAVESTHEALBUM.COM and share the link widely.","artists":[{"id":6767519,"name":"Basenji","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8165134.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8165134.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Basenji/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/officialbasenji/","tracker_count":25860,"url":"Basenji","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Oxford Art Factory","place":"Oxford Art Factory","city":"Sydney","region":"Nsw","country":"Australia","latitude":-33.877838,"longitude":151.213913},"ontour_id":"wpQBXBaikYJ7vKimk","genres":["aussietronica","deep australian indie","vapor twitch"]},{"id":10626108,"artist_id":6767519,"artist_event_id":13071160,"title":"Basenji @ 1015 Folsom in San Francisco, CA","datetime":"2015-10-22T22:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 10:00PM","formatted_location":"San Francisco, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/10626108?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Basenji&came_from=67","description":"BLOW UP, DJ Dials, & 1015 Folsom present FUTURE CLASSIC Records Showcase \nfeaturing \nCLASSIXX // SOPHIE  CYRIL HAHN // BASENJI  HNNY // CHARLES MURDOCH  ROLAND TINGS // KENTON SLASH DEMON FUTURE CLASSIC DJs  \nThursday October 22rd / 10pm - 2am / 21+ \n \n\n  \n \nCLASSIXX \nFacebook Twitter Soundcloud \nClassixx has become one of the most respected duos in dance music; a group equally adept at creating ubiquitous remixes and scene-creating DJ sets as their own funk-drenched house productions. Growing up in the Los Angeles suburb of Oak Park, David and Blake met in middle school, with the former soaking up everything from Guns N' Roses to New Age guitars while the latter was deep into West Coast punk.     In 2007, the stars aligned and the duo found themselves in Los Angeles and inspired by DFA Records and dance groups such as Soulwax and Digitalism. Both original productions and remixes would follow, with subsequent DJ sets added that would soon become a major element of the group in its own right. The uptempo “I’ll Get You” on Kitsuné Records and “No Strings,” produced for soul revivalist Mayer Hawthorne, showed different, yet equally compelling, aspects of the group, while remixes for Holy Ghost’s “I Will Come Back,” Mayer Hawthorne’s “Green Eyed Love” and Phoenix’s “Lisztomania” transcended insular circles and earned the duo international acclaim.    Pitchfork calls it \"gorgeously pillowy synth-disco\" \n \nClassixx — \"All You're Waiting For\" feat. Nancy Whang\nPlays: 508,596\n  \n\n  \n \nSOPHIE \nFacebook Twitter Soundcloud \nSOPHIE presents a precise sonic assault of pop hooks, hyperreal sound design and club rhythms, synthesized and sculpted live from raw waveforms on hardware equipment. Super sweet sugar candy hooks over visionary bass driven productions for the easyjet generation. Shake it up and make it fuzz.    185k+ Soundcloud plays #1 charted on Billboard’s ‘Emerging Artists’ chart (29 July) #1 most blogged Artist on Hype Machine (1st Aug)    FEATURED i-D, DAZED, SUP MAG, BBC RADIO 1, XLR8R    “‘Lemonade’ is a bouquet of ephemera, and we shouldn’t be surprised that SOPHIE hid a firecracker in the bundle.” Pitchfork    “Like SOPHIE’s best stuff to date, it sounds like literally nothing else in the world.” Pretty Much Amazing    “It is, once again, one of the best things I’ve heard all year.” Stereogum    “SOPHIE is currently responsible for some of the most unclassifiable future-pop music out there right now” CMJ    “From the start, ‘Lemonade’ shows that it’s far from prototypical with its bizarre sample choices, including the sounds of underwater bubbles and a tea kettle whistling. Later, song veers off the rails when it abruptly changes tone from hypnotic and beat-heavy to saccharine, overblown pop. Overall, it’s a crazy but thrilling listen.” Consequence of Sound    “A sharp, sugary tang. The rush of bubbles up the nose. That fizzy feeling . . . At under two minutes, it’s all over in a flash but the aftertaste lingers like Haribo Tangfastics: a sweet ‘n’ sour sugar crash that fogs up the brain, then has you dipping back in to kick your system back into gear.” The FADER    “SOPHIE always manages to make my favorite single of the summer.” Impose Magazine    “SOPHIE BIPP tune of the summer” DIPLO    “on closer inspection, “Bipp” is a classic case of an artist scrambling conventions and creating a next-level, irresitably fun club track in the process.” PITCHFORK BEST NEW TRACK    “Bipp has experienced underground music’s equivalent of going straight in at number one. Pitchfork made it a best new track, almost all the top magazines and blogs got in there, BBC Radio 1 played it on prime time, and Diplo said it was his “tune of the summer”. But not only does Bipp have that almost unattainably rare combination of high inventiveness and popular success, it’s one of the best signs yet of a new surge of life in the UK’s dance music underground.” DUMMY MAG \n \nSOPHIE - BIPP\nPlays: 588,441\n  \n\n  \n \nCYRIL HAHN \nFacebook Twitter Soundcloud \nThe best music is made by those who expose our very guilty pleasures with undeniable, stimulating creations. This can be said of the mere samples we have received this year from rising producer Cyril Hahn.    The Bern, Switzerland native experimented early on with music production during high school and abandoned it after leaving his hometown to pursue post-secondary in Vancouver, Canada. After a 3 year hiatus from music, feeling a need to return to his former love, he sat down and did what is considered by some to be taboo: stripped down two iconic R&B songs and gave them his unique atmospheric twist: Mariah Carey’s “TOUCH MY BODY” and Destiny’s Child “SAY MY NAME.”    Cyril’s’ re-works have hit a significant nerve with fans & other artists. In the summer of 2012, SAY MY NAME hit #1 on HYPEM in under 2 weeks, and to date has over 6 million plays on Soundcloud, countless tribute videos with over 10 million YouTube views. Other crowd favorites include his take on Solange’s LOSING YOU, a vibey, upbeat refix of labelmate Jessie Ware’s SWEET TALK and recently tapped by the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós for his take on their single RAFSTRAUMUR.    This fall Cyril released his debut single PERFECT FORM on his home label PMR Records, which instantly became one of this summers’ anthems. Look out for more shows and releases,feeding your guilty pleasures for years to come. \n \nDestiny's Child - Say My Name (Cyril Hahn Remix)\nPlays: 14,685,126\n  \n\n  \n \nBASENJI \nFacebook Twitter Soundcloud \nA new contender in the explosive wave of Australian producers making it big overseas, Basenji’s thoroughbred production has been phenomenally received since his debut single ‘Dawn’ hit the airwaves. Drawing on technicolor sounds from R&B and Footwork to homemade percussion and pulsating electronics, Basenji’s trajectory has seen millions of hits online and big-time support from the likes of Triple J and BBC1 (plus homie-support from Ryan Hemsworth, Stwo and Wave Racer). Throw in a national headline tour, appearances at the Sydney Opera House’s Vivid Live Festival and Splendour In The Grass, plus a performance for Boiler Room, and you have an impressive resume for an artist with only one official release to his name.    Having signed to Sydney powerhouse label Future Classic, Basenji’s upcoming debut EP will shed a new light on his young brand of organised chaos.
