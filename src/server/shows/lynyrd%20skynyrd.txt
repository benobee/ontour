Originally formed in 1964 as \"My Backyard\" in Jacksonville, Florida, the band was also known by names such as The Noble Five and One Percent, before finally deciding on Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1969. The band gained worldwide recognition for its live performances and signature songs \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Free Bird\". At the peak of their success, three members died in an airplane crash in 1977, putting an abrupt end to the band's most popular incarnation. The band has sold 28 million albums in the US.","artists":[{"id":564,"name":"Lynyrd
