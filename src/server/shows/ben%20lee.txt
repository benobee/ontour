are so excited to invite you to this very intimate and special performance by Ben Lee. Ben has been creating music for nearly a quarter of a century and has just released his 10th studio album, Love is the Great Rebellion. For those of you who know Ben and his music, you are familiar with his compassion, sense of humor, and desire to connect with his audience in meaningful ways.\nFalls, an acoustic duo from Australia, will open the show. Falls recently played the Firefly Music Festival, and will also be supporting Ben at his show at the City Winery in NYC. Check out Falls' EP Into the Fire.\nThis is a powerful way to support a great artist and have an opportunity to attend a uniquely personal event as part of your support. All profit from the sale of tickets goes directly to the artist. As with our previous shows, our goal is not to make money; rather, it is to have a great evening of music while supporting artists we admire and respect.\nAs of now, the tentative schedule is:\n6:00 PM: Doors open, and we welcome you to join us for music and conversation; BYO food and beverage \n7:00 PM: Falls will open the show.\n7:45 PM: Ben Lee will play a full acoustic set.\nWe will also be hosting a conversation, led by Ben, at 4PM, on his involvement with the Qollari doTERRA Project. If you are interested in more information about joining us for this talk, please email southburyhouseconcerts@gmail.com. \n","artists":[{"id":868,"name":"Ben Lee","mbid":"3a9f3479-4f0c-4355-8ccd-c9ed5cd01586","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7819216.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7819216.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BenLee/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/benleemusic","tracker_count":52246,"url":"BenLee","website":"http://ben-lee.com"}],"venue":{"name":"House Concert","place":"House Concert","city":"Oxford","region":"CT","country":"United States","latitude":41.4338889,"longitude":-73.1172222},"ontour_id":"EyckQ8Ztrwdqb8jW5","genres":["acoustic pop","anti-folk","australian alternative rock","folk-pop","indie folk","indie pop","neo mellow","pop rock","singer-songwriter"]},{"id":10178169,"artist_id":868,"artist_event_id":12384018,"title":"Ben Lee @ Project Learn School in Philadelphia, PA","datetime":"2015-07-05T17:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, July 5, 2015 at 5:00PM","formatted_location":"Philadelphia, PA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/10178169?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Ben+Lee&came_from=67","description":"House Concert/Benefit for Project Learn School.

Frontier Touring is pleased to announce that one of Australia’s best-loved singer/songwriters will return to our shores this spring to embark on a national tour, including special regional and outer city dates throughout October.\n\nLee's insightful lyrics and adept pop compositions - heard on gems like 'Cigarettes Will Kill You', 'Gamble Everything For Love', 'Running With Scissors', 'Love Me Like The World Is Ending' and countless others - have made him one of the Australia's most identifiable and celebrated popsmiths.\n\nLove Is The Great Rebellion is the tenth longplayer from the prolific artist, Lee's first since album since signing with Warner Bros. Records in Feb 2015. Led by charming single 'Big Love', for his latest longplayer the iconic 'Catch My Disease' singer returns to the familiar, unabashed sound he's loved for - upbeat, heart-on-sleeve pop. It's a family affair, too: Lee's wife, actress Ione Skye, makes an appearance, as does his five-year-old daughter Goldie and his father-in-law, '60s folk icon Donovan.\n\nTo record the predominant pop of Love Is The Great Rebellion Lee reteamed with acclaimed US producer Brad Wood (Liz Phair, Something For Kate) - producer of Lee's 4x ARIA-winning, double-platinum Awake Is The New Sleep. Back in 2005, that record hit #5 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and earned Lee a place in history with trophies for Song of the Year and Most Performed Australian Work at the 2005 APRA Awards. Meanwhile he also took out the #2 spot on triple j's Hottest 100.\n\nFrom his days fronting Noise Addict as a teen (admired by Thurston Moore and Mike D) to records about experiences with psychedelic brews (2013's Ayahuasca: Welcome to the Work), Ben Lee is one of a kind. Don't miss him playing across the country this October!\n\n\"Love Is The Great Rebellion feels like vintage Ben Lee\"- The Guardian \n\n\"With this album Lee once again proves what a talented songwriter he is ... a triumph that is sure to do well\" - Reverb\n\n\"Rediscovering the catchy, heartfelt pop ... Lee should win fans over easily with the new tunes - and some old favourites\" - Sydney Morning Herald","artists":[{"id":868,"name":"Ben

He made his stage debut in 1993, fronting the indie rock band Noise Addict, a foursome of Sydney school friends whose average age was only 14. The band was signed to labels such as Ecstatic Peace, founded by Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, and Grand Royal Records (by Mike D of the Beastie Boys). At just 16 years old, Ben Lee released his solo debut, Grandpaw Would, and has recorded a total of 12 albums, the latest being Freedom, Love and The Recuperation of the Human Mind (2016). Lee's resume also includes acting; he starred The Rage in Placid Lake (2003) with Rose Byrne, directed by Tony McNamara. Lee has collaborated with an impressive cross section of names in the the entertainment industry, including: Harmony Korine, Petra Haden, Liz Phair, Evan Dando and Jason Schwartzman, as well as Ben Folds and Ben Kweller with whom he recorded a 2004 EP called The Bens. He also founded his own label, Ten Fingers Records.About TiffanyTiffany Lee is from the heart of the Natural State of Arkansas. Since 14, Tiffany has been honing her songwriting craft, only starting to perform at the age of 17. Now 20, she is embarking on a new season of her music with the release of her debut EP, Jailbird. Her pop sound is something familiar, drawing from influences in soul and old spirituals, but completely fresh with an alternative pop groove. Her music takes you deeper into layers of eloquent storytelling, heart gripping conviction, and original sounds that will leave you grooving.","artists":[{"id":868,"name":"Ben Lee","mbid":"3a9f3479-4f0c-4355-8ccd-c9ed5cd01586","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7819216.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7819216.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BenLee/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/benleemusic","tracker_count":52246,"url":"BenLee","website":"http://ben-lee.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Capitol View Studio","place":"Capitol View Studio","city":"Little Rock","region":"AR","country":"United States","latitude":34.749281,"longitude":-92.283879},"ontour_id":"EyckQ8Ztrwdqb8jW5","genres":["acoustic pop","anti-folk","australian alternative rock","folk-pop","indie folk","indie pop","neo mellow","pop rock","singer-songwriter"]},{"id":14975963,"artist_id":868,"artist_event_id":19085923,"title":"Ben Lee @ Cairns Soundshell in Cairns, Australia","datetime":"2017-09-14T08:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 8:00AM","formatted_location":"Cairns, Australia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14975963?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Ben+Lee&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":868,"name":"Ben Lee","mbid":"3a9f3479-4f0c-4355-8ccd-c9ed5cd01586","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7819216.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7819216.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BenLee/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/benleemusic","tracker_count":52246,"url":"BenLee","website":"http://ben-lee.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Cairns Soundshell","place":"Cairns Soundshell","city":"Cairns","region":"Qld","country":"Australia","latitude":-16.86817,"longitude":145.76273},"ontour_id":"EyckQ8Ztrwdqb8jW5","genres":["acoustic pop","anti-folk","australian alternative rock","folk-pop","indie folk","indie pop","neo mellow","pop rock","singer-songwriter"]},{"id":15359187,"artist_id":868,"artist_event_id":19623300,"title":"Ben Lee @ Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2017-11-07T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, November 7, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-08-27T14:45:58","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15359187?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Ben+Lee&came_from=67","description":"\"B is for Beer\" The Musical, created by Tom Robbins & Ben Lee and directed by Jon Cryer","artists":[{"id":868,"name":"Ben Lee","mbid":"3a9f3479-4f0c-4355-8ccd-c9ed5cd01586","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7819216.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7819216.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BenLee/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/benleemusic","tracker_count":52246,"url":"BenLee","website":"http://ben-lee.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Largo at the Coronet","place":"Largo at the Coronet","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.077949,"longitude":-118.376198},"ontour_id":"EyckQ8Ztrwdqb8jW5","genres":["acoustic pop","anti-folk","australian alternative rock","folk-pop","indie folk","indie pop","neo mellow","pop rock","singer-songwriter"]}]
