his annual “Merry Christmas From the Fam-o-Lee” extravaganza, Saturday’s return of Robert Earl will no doubt feature strings of lights, a stocking or two, and fake snow in abundance. So consider this plug a holiday wish that Keen saves some room in his set for a few songs from his latest album, Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions. Released way back in February, Prisoner may not be that much of a stretch — Houston-born Keen has been a bluegrass fan all his life — but it is a pleasure to listen to all the same, as Keen and his guests Peter Rowan, Natalie Maines, Lyle Lovett (naturally) and former Bad Liver Danny Barnes on banjo romp through a frisky set of covers that ranges from Richard Thompson’s “1952 Vincent Black Lightning” to Bill Monroe’s “Footprints In the Snow” and the old country standbys “Long Black Veil” and “Wayfaring Stranger.” For Keen fans, it’s about as good as his albums — or bluegrass — get.  With the Doyle and Debbie Show.","artists":[{"id":160878,"name":"The Doyle & Debbie Show","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/4698304.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/4698304.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheDoyleAndDebbieShow/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":11,"url":"TheDoyleAndDebbieShow","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"House Of Blues","place":"House Of Blues","city":"Houston","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":29.753847,"longitude":-95.363704},"ontour_id":"yQik87jenZnWanbYY","genres":[]},{"id":12790199,"artist_id":160878,"artist_event_id":16047755,"title":"The Doyle & Debbie Show @ The Mint in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2016-11-10T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, November 10, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12790199?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Doyle+%26+Debbie+Show&came_from=67","description":"Brittany B. / The HiGrounds (Late Show Doors 10:00)","artists":[{"id":160878,"name":"The Doyle & Debbie Show","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/4698304.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/4698304.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheDoyleAndDebbieShow/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":11,"url":"TheDoyleAndDebbieShow","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"The Mint","place":"The Mint","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.0522586,"longitude":-118.371633},"ontour_id":"yQik87jenZnWanbYY","genres":[]},{"id":15448112,"artist_id":160878,"artist_event_id":20270463,"title":"The Doyle & Debbie Show @ Knight Theater in Charlotte, NC","datetime":"2017-12-01T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, December 1, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Charlotte, NC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15448112?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Doyle+%26+Debbie+Show&came_from=67","description":"ROBERT EARL KEEN'S \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE FAM-O-LEE\" SHOW","artists":[{"id":160878,"name":"The Doyle & Debbie Show","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/4698304.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/4698304.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheDoyleAndDebbieShow/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":11,"url":"TheDoyleAndDebbieShow","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Knight Theater","place":"Knight Theater","city":"Charlotte","region":"NC","country":"United States","latitude":35.2242679,"longitude":-80.8473758},"ontour_id":"yQik87jenZnWanbYY","genres":[]}]
