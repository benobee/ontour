show is 21 and over. \nMark Eitzel is best known as lead singer of the San Francisco band American Music Club. He was voted Rolling Stone's Songwriter of the Year in 1991. Eitzel's first solo album was the (now elusive) cassette-only 'Mean Mark Eitzel Gets Fat' (1982), which pre-dates his AMC work. He released a solo live album, songs of love live in 1991, featuring raw and emotional acoustic versions of his best AMC songs. His first solo album proper was 1996's 60 Watt Silver Lining, a highly personal, jazz-inflected work.\nHe went on to release albums of varying styles and quality, including another difficult-to-find effort in Lover's Leap USA, produced as a tour-only CD and notable for including two songs which Eitzel's own sleeve notes instruct the listener to skip past. This was followed by 1997's West, a collaboration with REM's Peter Buck, and the stark and harrowing Caught in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'Cause I Love You Too Much, Baby in 1998. 2001 saw him take a new electronic direction with The Invisible Man, followed in 2002 by two covers projects: Music for courage & confidence and The Ugly American, which included re-interpretations of American Music Club songs by Eitzel and a traditional Greek band!\nThe Mark Eitzel discussion list Firefly can be found at http://mail.neurotica.com/mailman/listinfo/firefly\nHowe Gelb is an American artist who has fronted the band Giant Sand since the 80s, as well as several side projects, including The Band of Blacky Ranchette, OP8 and Arizona Amp and Alternator. Inaccurately yet affectionately dubbed “the Godfather of Alt. Country” by the British press, Tucson, Arizona-based musician Howe Gelb has remained the sole epicenter and creative force behind the ever-fluid configurations of Giant Sand for over a quarter century, giving birth along the way to an extended musical family tree that fostered the likes of The Band of…Blacky Ranchette, The Friends of Dean Martinez, OP8, and Calexico.\nAlso lending themselves to the casual mix are a host of talented friends/collaborators–such as Neko Case, M. Ward, Isobell Campbell, Henriette Sennenvaldt, Lucie Idlout and Lonna Kelley–all of whom ease warmly into the passenger seat to ride shotgun for a while on an album thick with musings scattered by the desert winds and soaked with eroding guitars or dusty piano.\nProviding an alternate route around box-store labels like “Alt. Country” while ruminating on love and loss in the socio-political climate of a modern world at odds with itself, proVISIONS is a creeping cruise down a dark desert highway, forging another surprising and welcome byway in the completely unique musical legacy of Giant Sand.","artists":[{"id":31000,"name":"Mark

Eitzel & BANDplus supportFernando Band - PortlandMark Eitzel’s tenth solo album and his first in three years, Hey Mr Ferryman, will be released on January 27, 2017, by Decor Records on LP, limited edition lp w bonus disc, cd and download.Hey Mr Ferryman is Eitzel’s first full studio album recorded entirely in London. It was made at 355 Studios with Mercury Prize winner Bernard Butler (ex-Suede, McAlmont & Butler), who has produced and/or recorded albums with Tricky, Ben Watt, Bert Jansch, Edwyn Collins, and more. Butler produced Hey Mr Ferryman and played all of the electric guitar, bass, and keyboard parts on the album.Butler wrote of the process: “I spent a fortnight on my own in the studio seeing where I could go, how to expand every mood, make the dark songs darker, the drama bigger, the joy more celebratory. I was elated when I sent initial mixes off and Mark was happy. The greatest gift for a producer is the trust of the artist with their work. I knew from the off with this record that the songwriting was in a different league. It was for me to find beautiful frames for each story.”Mark says of the album “Many of these songs I demo’d 4-5 times with different musicians and arrangements over a couple of years including the great Bruce Kaphan and Patrick Main as well as my UK band - and somehow they never came together for me. My manager met Bernard Butler at the school gates where their children go and asked if he would be interested. I sent Bernard my 15 demos and our original idea was to make an acoustic album because the budget was severely limited - but he had different ideas and insisted on re-recording the whole thing and did an absolutely amazing job. I think this might be the best record I have made since recording with Tom Mallon of American Music Club. He produced the songs much as I imagined them - though I didn’t know it.”Hey Mr Ferryman features the vivid melodies long associated with Eitzel’s former band American Music Club (a.k.a. AMC), which remains a cult favorite to this day, as well as Butler’s distinctive guitar that serves to complement Eitzel’s expressive vocals. Of that voice, Pitchfork once wrote: “If Leonard Cohen’s voice is a story about the passage of time and Levon Helm’s is a story about losing what is most precious to you, Eitzel’s is about the circuitous roads we take in search of ourselves.”As both a solo artist and the frontman for AMC, Mark Eitzel is a celebrated lyricist and champion of the downtrodden. A hauntingly evocative singer, he has earned even greater notoriety for his brilliance as a composer, combining the intensity of Ian Curtis, the pastoral beauty of Nick Drake, and the melodrama of Scott Walker and Jacques Brel to build one of the most impressive and darkly poetic bodies of song in the modern pop canon.“The songs on this record are about celebrating musicians and music, about misogyny, the long shadow of history, getting one’s head out of one’s ass,” quips Eitzel on the themes of Ferryman. “Also oceans, blood, skies, hearts, gay pioneers, carpenters, weeping women, and how death waits for you even in the happiest place on earth: Las Vegas.”The album opens with “The Last Ten Years” which includes the lyric “Spent the last ten years / Trying to waste half an hour” which, like the best verses, will leave you pensive and wanting more. The album continues with a sensuous love song (“An Answer”), an ode to the plight of the working musician (“The Road”), the growing political divide in America (“In My Role as Professional Singer and Ham”), the frustration of ripped trousers (“Let Me Go”), and “Sleep From My Eyes,” which Mark describes as “an experiment to write a love song from the point of view of someone in a coma. As you do.”“As I wrote these songs, I moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles; painted two houses; spent all my money; threw away everything I owned; traveled to and from London, New York; performed various shows; gained and lost and gained 20 pounds; went to the doctor a lot; moved to the mountains; moved to New York; and ran my car into the ground,” continues Eitzel.Mark Eitzel has released over 15 albums of original material with American Music Club and as a solo artist. The Guardian has called him “America’s greatest living lyricist,” and Rolling Stone once gave him their Songwriter of the Year award. Originally formed in 1983, AMC released seven albums before breaking up in 1995. The band reunited in 2004 for two full-lengths, Love Songs for Patriots and The Golden Age. In April of 2012 while working on a solo record, Eitzel suffered a heart attack which forced him to slow down and delayed the album’s release. That fall, Décor Records put out Don’t Be a Stranger to much critical acclaim, and in 2013, a newly healthy Eitzel embarked on what proved to be the most successful tour of his career to date. In 2015, he wrote music for Simon Stephens’ Song from Far Away, his second collaboration with the English playwright, and began work on the forthcoming Hey Mr Ferryman.","artists":[{"id":31000,"name":"Mark

Eitzel's tenth solo album and his first in three years, Hey Mr Ferryman, will be released on January 27, 2017, by Decor & Merge Records on LP, limited edition LP w/bonus disc, cd and download. Hey Mr Ferryman is Eitzel's first full studio album recorded entirely in London. It was made at 355 Studios with Mercury Prize winner Bernard Butler (ex-Suede, McAlmont & Butler), who has produced and/or recorded albums with Tricky, Ben Watt, Bert Jansch, Edwyn Collins, and more. Butler produced Hey Mr Ferryman and played all of the electric guitar, bass, and keyboard parts on the album. Butler wrote of the process: I spent a fortnight on my own in the studio seeing where I could go, how to expand every mood, make the dark songs darker, the drama bigger, the joy more celebratory. I was elated when I sent initial mixes off and Mark was happy. The greatest gift for a producer is the trust of the artist with their work. I knew from the off with this record that the songwriting was in a different league. It was for me to find beautiful frames for each story. Mark says of the album Many of these songs I demo'd 4-5 times with different musicians and arrangements over a couple of years including the great Bruce Kaphan and Patrick Main as well as my UK band  and somehow they never came together for me. My manager met Bernard Butler at the school gates where their children go and asked if he would be interested. I sent Bernard my 15 demos and our original idea was to make an acoustic album because the budget was severely limited  but he had different ideas and insisted on re-recording the whole thing and did an absolutely amazing job. I think this might be the best record I have made since recording with Tom Mallon of American Music Club. He produced the songs much as I imagined them  though I didn't know it. Hey Mr Ferryman features the vivid melodies long associated with Eitzel's former band American Music Club (aka AMC), which remains a cult favorite to this day, as well as Butler's distinctive guitar that serves to complement Eitzel's expressive vocals. Of that voice, Pitchfork once wrote: If Leonard Cohen's voice is a story about the passage of time and Levon Helm's is a story about losing what is most precious to you, Eitzel's is about the circuitous roads we take in search of ourselves. As both a solo artist and the frontman for AMC, Mark Eitzel is a celebrated lyricist and champion of the downtrodden. A hauntingly evocative singer, he has earned even greater notoriety for his brilliance as a composer, combining the intensity of Ian Curtis, the pastoral beauty of Nick Drake, and the melodrama of Scott Walker and Jacques Brel to build one of the most impressive and darkly poetic bodies of song in the modern pop canon. The songs on this record are about celebrating musicians and music, about misogyny, the long shadow of history, getting one's head out of one's ass, quips Eitzel on the themes of Ferryman. Also oceans, blood, skies, hearts, gay pioneers, carpenters, weeping women, and how death waits for you even in the happiest place on earth: Las Vegas. The album opens with The Last Ten Years which includes the lyric, Spent the last ten years / Trying to waste half an hour which, like the best verses, will leave you pensive and wanting more. The album continues with a sensuous love song (An Answer), an ode to the plight of the working musician (The Road), the growing political divide in America (In My Role as Professional Singer and Ham), the frustration of ripped trousers (Let Me Go), and Sleep From My Eyes, which Mark describes as an experiment to write a love song from the point of view of someone in a coma. As you do. As I wrote these songs, I moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles; painted two houses; spent all my money; threw away everything I owned; traveled to and from London, New York; performed various shows; gained and lost and gained 20 pounds; went to the doctor a lot; moved to the mountains; moved to New York; and ran my car into the ground, continues Eitzel. Mark Eitzel has released over 15 albums of original material with American Music Club and as a solo artist. The Guardian has called him America's greatest living lyricist, and Rolling Stone once gave him their Songwriter of the Year award. Originally formed in 1983, AMC released seven albums before breaking up in 1995. The band reunited in 2004 for two full-lengths, Love Songs for Patriots and The Golden Age. In April of 2012 while working on a solo record, Eitzel suffered a heart attack which forced him to slow down and delayed the album's release. That fall, Decor & Merge Records put out Don't Be a Stranger to much critical acclaim, and in 2013, a newly healthy Eitzel embarked on what proved to be the most successful tour of his career to date. In 2015, he wrote music for Simon Stephens' Song from Far Away, his second collaboration with the English playwright, and began work on the forthcoming Hey Mr Ferryman.","artists":[{"id":31000,"name":"Mark Eitzel","mbid":"80b694db-8f5e-485f-b589-17d7853140b0","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5272170.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5272170.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MarkEitzel/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4716,"url":"MarkEitzel","website":"http://www.markeitzel.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Brudenell Social Club","place":"Brudenell Social Club","city":"Leeds","region":"United Kingdom","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":53.809667,"longitude":-1.570182},"ontour_id":"XYPxF8wh4McRyhmXc","genres":["anti-folk","chamber pop","lo-fi","melancholia","slow core"]},{"id":14612286,"artist_id":31000,"artist_event_id":18627793,"title":"Mark Eitzel @ The Glee Club in Nottingham, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-11-09T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Nottingham, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-05-15T00:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14612286?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Mark+Eitzel&came_from=67","description":"Mark Eitzel & Band","artists":[{"id":31000,"name":"Mark Eitzel","mbid":"80b694db-8f5e-485f-b589-17d7853140b0","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5272170.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5272170.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MarkEitzel/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4716,"url":"MarkEitzel","website":"http://www.markeitzel.com"}],"venue":{"name":"The Glee Club","place":"The Glee Club","city":"Nottingham","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":52.9479758,"longitude":-1.1415509},"ontour_id":"XYPxF8wh4McRyhmXc","genres":["anti-folk","chamber pop","lo-fi","melancholia","slow core"]},{"id":15463867,"artist_id":31000,"artist_event_id":19910415,"title":"Mark Eitzel @ St Pancras New Church in London, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-11-11T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, November 11, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"London, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-06-12T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15463867?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Mark+Eitzel&came_from=67","description":"This multi-venue event showcasing folk and roots artists will be back in London in November 2017.\n\nPlease visit http://londonfolkandroots.com/ for more information.","artists":[{"id":31000,"name":"Mark Eitzel","mbid":"80b694db-8f5e-485f-b589-17d7853140b0","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5272170.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5272170.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MarkEitzel/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4716,"url":"MarkEitzel","website":"http://www.markeitzel.com"}],"venue":{"name":"St Pancras New Church","place":"St Pancras New Church","city":"London","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.527077,"longitude":-0.13019},"ontour_id":"XYPxF8wh4McRyhmXc","genres":["anti-folk","chamber pop","lo-fi","melancholia","slow core"]},{"id":16026531,"artist_id":31000,"artist_event_id":20581218,"title":"Mark Eitzel @ ZEBULON in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2018-01-21T21:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, January 21, 2018 at 9:00PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16026531/buy_tickets?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Mark+Eitzel&came_from=67","ticket_type":"Tickets","ticket_status":"available","on_sale_datetime":"2017-11-22T15:55:02","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16026531?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Mark+Eitzel&came_from=67","description":"Simone White, Mark Eitzel","artists":[{"id":31000,"name":"Mark Eitzel","mbid":"80b694db-8f5e-485f-b589-17d7853140b0","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5272170.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5272170.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MarkEitzel/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4716,"url":"MarkEitzel","website":"http://www.markeitzel.com"}],"venue":{"name":"ZEBULON","place":"ZEBULON","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.107193,"longitude":-118.254732},"ontour_id":"XYPxF8wh4McRyhmXc","genres":["anti-folk","chamber pop","lo-fi","melancholia","slow core"]}]
