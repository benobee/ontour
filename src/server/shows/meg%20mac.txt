Our Big Gig is a mid-festival music feast featuring:\r\n\r\nTHE PAPER KITES.\r\nThese Melbourne based folk favourites are hot off a headline sell-out tour of the US and Canada in support of their debut album States, which recently hit #17 on the ARIA charts.\r\n\r\nHUSKY.\r\nReturning to Dungog after their visit supporting the Gentleman of the Road Tour, the APRA award winning group showcase their signature sounds alongside their hotly anticipated second album due later this year.\r\n\r\nMEG MAC.\r\nRecently unearthed by Triple J, Meg Mac’s sensational, dark, neo-soul voice is set to storm the Aussie charts with her debut, self titled EP.\r\n\r\nYour Big Gig ticket delivers all three acts under one roof.","artists":[{"id":5498522,"name":"MEG

Meg had previously met Leon and Austin on the road and talked about the possibility of working together. So when she was working out of LA she decided to fly to Fort Worth to check out their studio. The connection was immediate; after spending the day with them working on a song Meg decided to book in to record her album.   \n\nMeg Mac will commence a US tour early in June, playing New York’s iconic Bowery Ballroom before heading to markets like Chicago and San Francisco, with an appearance at Firefly Festival and winding up in LA.

Since being discovered through Triple J’s Unearthed competition in 2014, Meg Mac has become one of Australia’s most exciting new talents. After charming festival audiences at Groovin’ the Moo, Falls Festival and Splendour in the Grass, Meg Mac’s debut album Low Blows entered the Australian charts at No.2 in July 2017. Now the ARIA Award nominee is set to headline the AO Open Sessions on Thursday 18 January.
