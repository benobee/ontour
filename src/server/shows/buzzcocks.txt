Séparé dès 1981 après seulement trois albums, le groupe a eu la bonne idée de se retrouver autour du chanteur Pete Shelley et du guitariste Steve Diggle. Avec une rage intacte et un répertoire riche de classiques et de nouvelles pépites qui perpétuent le rêve ado-punk. Sixteen Again ! Album : The Way (1-2-3-4 Records, 2014)\n\nCes trois moines psychotiques n’ont qu’une religion : celle d’un rock’n’roll crade à haute teneur psychédélique. Dans leur cave parisienne, les Psychotic Monks invoquent Queens of the Stone Age et Arctic Monkeys, la puissance brute et les harmonies vocales, l’électricité et les mélodies. Tous au monastère !

Buzzcocks have endured despite their lack of activity. Though they’ve cut a popular figure in the 21st century due to their depiction in several films, the band has remained low-key in the years since their first break up. With only three albums to their name in in the past 16 years, the band has kept a low profile stateside, with only a handful of dates per tour. This current run is in support of the band’s 40th anniversary, something few would have expected to have happened when the band first sneered and snarled their way into music fans’ radar.","artists":[{"id":3193,"name":"Buzzcocks","mbid":"31e9c35b-2675-4632-8596-f9bd9286f6c8","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5445520.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5445520.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Buzzcocks/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":132418,"url":"Buzzcocks","website":"http://www.buzzcocks.com"}],"venue":{"name":"The

présente : Buzzcocks + Gonzaï dj-set MCR+ – Une saison Manchester à l’Aéronef : Suivez nous toute la saison 2016 / 2017 pour un voyage au cœur de la diversité culturelle et artistique mancunienne. Musique, architecture, football, littérature… une énergie débordante portée par une population attachante et accueillante. Retrouvez tous nos événements Manchester grâce à l’abeille, emblème de la ville reprise en pictogramme dans tous nos programmes. Sex Pistols/Buzzcocks, Never Mind The Bollocks/Orgasm Addict… S’il est avéré que les Buzzcocks se sont bien pris les Pistols à pleines tempes, on aurait tort de considérer ce groupe crucial comme une pâle déclinaison provinciale des arrogants londoniens. S’il faut causer réplique, c’est au sens tellurique du terme. Sans styliste mais avec classe et depuis Manchester, les Buzzcocks ont donc bâti une œuvre toujours bien vivante. À la base, des jeunes gens issus de la working class mettant un point d’honneur à sortir du rang en vénérant le Velvet Underground, The Stooges , mais restant fidèles à l’Union Jack des Who, Kinks et Roxy Music. Au fil de ses trois premiers albums exemplaires, le groupe s’est imposé, après les Modern Lovers et avec les Only Ones, comme l’un des rares catalyseurs de son époque, cristallisant la sophistication pop et l’urgence DIY. De l’accouchement punk aux attouchements new wave, tout cela s’est déroulé entre 1975 et 79 et demeure d’une fraîcheur imprescriptible. Pete Shelley, âme historique du groupe, sait ce qu’il en coûte d’être bisexuel et iconoclaste dans le violent conformisme des lads mancuniens. Cette sensibilité et cette ironie subtilement revancharde, on les retrouve dans les textes mordants, les guitares incisives et des rythmiques qui se sont très vite émancipées d’un punk devenu bas du front. Peu importe qu’ils ne figurent pas sur le podium Pistols-Clash-Damned, les Buzzcocks relèvent plus du jardin secret que des champs de course. Écouter les Buzzcocks aujourd’hui c’est se frotter au répertoire, un grattoir responsable de nombre d’étincelles chez les Smiths, Hüsker Dü, Nirvana, Weezer…et tout ce qui pétille encore aujourd’hui. Finalement, on vieillit bien quand on ne se résume pas à une génération ou un style musical. Vaillants et vibrants.","artists":[{"id":3193,"name":"Buzzcocks","mbid":"31e9c35b-2675-4632-8596-f9bd9286f6c8","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5445520.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5445520.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Buzzcocks/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":132418,"url":"Buzzcocks","website":"http://www.buzzcocks.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Aeronef","place":"Aeronef","city":"Lille","region":null,"country":"France","latitude":50.63679,"longitude":3.073692},"ontour_id":"efvZjxzNCCakkSkHc","genres":["alternative
