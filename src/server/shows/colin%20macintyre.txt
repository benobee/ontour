Combing through a 15-year back catalogue, from familiar singles like ‘Barcode Bypass’, ‘Watching Xanadu’, and ‘The Final Arrears’, to gems plucked from his latest like ‘Build Another Brick’, ‘The Ballad of Ivor Punch’ and ‘Sleepy Hollow’, it’ll be a night crammed full of lyrical tales. Complemented by award-winning prose and passages read by Colin from his first novel, it will be an enthralling insight into Colin’s larger-than-life talent and charming, modest persona.\n \n‘Build Another Brick’ will also be Mull Historical Society’s next single, which you can listen to here. It’s the opening track from Dear Satellite, ten tracks of floating, positive, textually diverse pop songs, produced by Grammy award-winning Dom Morley, known for his work on Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, as well as working with Adele, Grinderman and Sting.\n \nThe show and single celebrate a very successful 12 months. Starting last October, when The Letters of Ivor Punch won the Edinburgh International Book Festival’s First Book award, he then released seventh album Dear Satellite through Xtra Mile Recordings to wide acclaim six months later, in April. The paperback version of his novel came out a month later. Since then he’s played a handful of sold out shows, revealed a new electronic pop project called Field Stars, and will now play one of his final shows of 2016, both as a thank you and a farewell to a fantastic year.\n \n‘From Stage to Page’ evening of words and music, 2 December 2016 at St Pancras Old Church, London.
