$20\r\nSpecial guest: New Kingston\r\nhttp://jazzbones.com\r\n\r\nhttp://thegreen808.com\r\n\r\nFormed in 2009 on Oahu, Hawaii, THE GREEN blends roots reggae with traditional Hawaiian vibes. Their new single \"Liar\" is out now on Easy Star Records. The Green's sophomore album \"Ways & Means\" spent four weeks at #1 on Billboard's Reggae Chart. Their self-titled debut album was named iTunes Best Reggae Album of 2010.\r\n\r\n\"The Green's powerful sonic identity fuses late 1970s-era dub-heavy roots reggae (reminiscent of English bands like Aswad and Steel Pulse) with strands of contemporary rock/pop/R&B and sporadic indigenous Hawaiian musical and lyrical references. That appealing synthesis has catapulted The Green to the forefront of Hawaii’s thriving reggae scene.\" – Billboard\r\n\r\nhttp://newkingstonmusic.com\r\n","artists":[{"id":965673,"name":"The
