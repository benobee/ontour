When he wasn't on the stage with Dave, Shaffer was out collaborating with everyone from R&B legend Bobby Womack to classic \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members Gilda Radner and John Belushi. In this show at the beautiful Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, Shaffer lights up the stage with his group, The World's Most Dangerous Band, hot on the heels of the release of their latest album. They'll be joined for this concert by singer Valerie Simpson, half of the songwriting/performing/producing duo formerly known as Ashford and Simpson.","artists":[{"id":372728,"name":"Paul Shaffer","mbid":"2944725e-3dcb-432e-b575-0bed5cef3504","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5120503.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5120503.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/PaulShaffer/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":2289,"url":"PaulShaffer","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Ames Center","place":"Ames Center","city":"Burnsville","region":"MN","country":"United States","latitude":44.774079,"longitude":-93.279512},"ontour_id":"aTQEaBu53rMRegjh5","genres":[]},{"id":14886441,"artist_id":372728,"artist_event_id":18964229,"title":"Paul Shaffer @ Playstation Theater in New York, NY","datetime":"2017-08-08T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14886441?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Paul+Shaffer&came_from=67","description":"Paul Shaffer, Bobby Valentine, George Martin, Tony Bennett","artists":[{"id":372728,"name":"Paul Shaffer","mbid":"2944725e-3dcb-432e-b575-0bed5cef3504","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5120503.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5120503.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/PaulShaffer/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":2289,"url":"PaulShaffer","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Playstation Theater","place":"Playstation Theater","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.757932,"longitude":-73.986072},"ontour_id":"aTQEaBu53rMRegjh5","genres":[]},{"id":15329012,"artist_id":372728,"artist_event_id":19582216,"title":"Paul Shaffer @ Cleopatra’s Barge at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, NV","datetime":"2017-12-21T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, December 21, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Las Vegas, NV","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-08-25T17:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15329012?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Paul+Shaffer&came_from=67","description":"Legendary bandleader, multi-instrumentalist, singer, composer and comedian Paul Shaffer brings his trademark musical style to the intimate Cleopatra's Barge at Caesars Palace for a limited three-week run.
