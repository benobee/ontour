Still Indianapolis’s largest live music venue, the Egyptian Room is the smaller of two auditoriums, boasting a standing capacity of 2000. In 2010, following a considerable court battle, the Murat was renamed Old National Centre.

Its construction is a tale of divine inspiration. In the 1880s, when prominent businessman and steamboat captain Thomas G. Ryman found salvation in the words of fiery evangelist Reverend Sam Jones, he vowed to build a great tabernacle that would project Rev. Jones’s voice clearly and powerfully for all to hear. Designed by architect Hugh Cathcart Thompson in the Late Victorian Gothic Revival style popular at the time, Tom Ryman’s vision became a reality with the completion of the Union Gospel Tabernacle in 1892. After his death in 1904, the Union Gospel Tabernacle would henceforth be known as the Ryman Auditorium in honor of the man who built the Nashville landmark. \r\n","artists":[{"id":994,"name":"Feist","mbid":"a670e05a-cea8-4b37-bce9-d82daf1a0fa4","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6163244.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6163244.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Feist/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/feist","tracker_count":566160,"url":"Feist","website":"http://www.listentofeist.com"},{"id":242143,"name":"Timber Timbre","mbid":"89942abd-fdaa-48fc-a8cf-649746303c97","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TimberTimbre/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/timbertimbre","tracker_count":68052,"url":"TimberTimbre","website":"http://www.timbertimbre.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Ryman Auditorium","place":"Ryman Auditorium","city":"Nashville","region":"TN","country":"United States","latitude":36.162219,"longitude":-86.779399},"ontour_id":"P3uZsxjK43bSLZsgL","genres":["alternative rock","anti-folk","canadian indie","canadian pop","chamber pop","dream pop","folk christmas","folk-pop","freak folk","indie christmas","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","neo mellow","pop rock","singer-songwriter","slow core","stomp and holler"]},{"id":5220700,"artist_id":994,"artist_event_id":4659484,"title":"Feist @ The Orange Peel in Asheville, NC","datetime":"2012-05-02T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, May 2, 2012 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Asheville, NC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2012-02-01T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/5220700?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Feist&came_from=67","description":"Due to technical constraints beyond our control, Feist at the Thomas Wolfe Auditorium on May 2nd is being moved to The Orange Peel.

Rockefeller, Jr. held a $91 million, 24-year lease on a piece of midtown Manhattan property properly known as \"the speakeasy belt.\" Plans to gentrify the neighborhood by building a new Metropolitan Opera House on the site were dashed by the failing economy and the business outlook was dim. Nevertheless, Rockefeller made a bold decision that would leave a lasting impact on the city's architectural and cultural landscape. He decided to build an entire complex of buildings on the property-buildings so superior that they would attract commercial tenants even in a depressed city flooded with vacant rental space. The project would express the highest ideals of architecture and design and stand as a symbol of optimism and hope.\r\n\r\nThe search for a commercial partner led to the Radio Corporation of America, a young company whose NBC radio programs were attracting huge audiences and whose RKO studios were producing and distributing popular motion pictures that offered welcome diversion in hard times. Rockefeller's financial power and RCA's media might were joined by the unusual talents of impresario S.L. \"Roxy\" Rothafel. Roxy had earned a reputation as a theatrical genius by employing an innovative combination of vaudeville, movies and razzle-dazzle decor to revive struggling theatres across America. Together Rockefeller, RCA and Roxy realized a fantastic dream - a theatre unlike any in the world, and the first completed project within the complex that RCA head David Sarnoff dubbed \"Radio City.\" Radio City Music Hall was to be a palace for the people. A place of beauty offering high-quality entertainment at prices ordinary people could afford. It was intended to entertain and amuse, but also to elevate and inspire.","artists":[{"id":994,"name":"Feist","mbid":"a670e05a-cea8-4b37-bce9-d82daf1a0fa4","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6163244.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6163244.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Feist/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/feist","tracker_count":566160,"url":"Feist","website":"http://www.listentofeist.com"},{"id":242143,"name":"Timber Timbre","mbid":"89942abd-fdaa-48fc-a8cf-649746303c97","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TimberTimbre/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/timbertimbre","tracker_count":68052,"url":"TimberTimbre","website":"http://www.timbertimbre.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Radio City Music Hall","place":"Radio City Music Hall","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.649903,"longitude":-74.001935},"ontour_id":"P3uZsxjK43bSLZsgL","genres":["alternative rock","anti-folk","canadian indie","canadian pop","chamber pop","dream pop","folk christmas","folk-pop","freak folk","indie christmas","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","neo mellow","pop rock","singer-songwriter","slow core","stomp and holler"]},{"id":4921251,"artist_id":994,"artist_event_id":4205195,"title":"Feist @ House of Blues - Boston in Boston, MA","datetime":"2012-05-07T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Monday, May 7, 2012 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Boston, MA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2012-02-01T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/4921251?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Feist&came_from=67","description":"Dedicated Red Sox fans have sold out every home game at Fenway Park since May 15th, 2003.

Carved out of sandstone, the stage sits at 6,450 feet above sea level, walled in by the dramatic twin towers of Ship Rock and Creation Rock. Today a park, from here you can see a panoramic view of the city of Denver. In 1905, John Brisben Walker, then publisher and editor of Cosmopolitan Magazine, thought the view and this venue so important, he sold the magazine to William Randolph Hearst for a million dollars and moved to Denver to personally finance and oversee it's development as an outdoor concert platform. He built the first stage at Red Rocks in 1906, and renamed it \"Garden of the Titans\".  Despite some success, following a series of misfortunes, he sold Red Rocks to the City of Denver in 1927 and die penniless in Brooklyn.  The amphitheatre that stands today was designed by Burnham Hoyt in 1941, with the express intent of preserving the natural beauty of the setting. With seating for 9450 people, it is considered one of the natural wonders of the world. On May 31st we will climb the red hill that leads to the Garden of the Titans with our trusted ally Bon Iver.

Today, twenty-five years later, it has become the second largest festival of its kind in Western Canada. \r\n\r\nFeist will headline The 25th anniversary of the Festival at Bessborough Gardens on the site of the historic Bessborough hotel on June 23. The landmark provides a picturesque eastern terminating vista for Saskatoon's 21st Street East and is also a view terminus on Spadina Crescent from points south of the hotel.\r\n \r\nAfter the Canadian Pacific Railway built a railway hotel in Regina in 1926, the Saskatoon business community lobbied Canadian National Railway to build one in Saskatoon. On December 31, 1928 Sir Henry Thorton, President of the Canadian National Railway, announced that they would build a similar hotel in Saskatoon. The hotel was designed by Archibald and Schofield of Montreal, and intentionally designed to resemble a Bavarian castle. In February, 1930, the excavation of the site began utilizing a steam thawer and gasoline excavator. Materials used in construction were of Canadian origin including Tyndall stone from Manitoba, brick from the Claybank Brick Plant in Claybank, Saskatchewan, and tiles from Estevan, Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nTickets go onsale February 29 at 10am local time.

concept of the Christie Reservoir was born in 1958 when the newly-formed Spencer Creek Conservation Authority was searching for solutions to the flooding issues along the Spencer Creek, especially in Dundas. Land purchases began in 1962 and after years of study and approvals, construction of the Christie Dam began in May of 1970. The Christie Dam serves not only to virtually eliminate downstream flooding; it also creates the recreational lake we know today maintaining a habitat for a wide range of wildlife. Christie Lake Conservation Area officially opened in June of 1974.\r\n\r\nToday, Christie Lake is one of the most beautiful lake settings on the Niagara Escarpment. Within its 336 hectares (830 acres) are 10 kilometres of trails, a wildlife management area, wide open spaces, tall grass prairie meadows, forests and a 360 metre sand beach. Visitors may enjoy all the great outdoors has to offer with canoeing, fishing, swimming, picnicking, hiking, and even cross-country skiing when conditions permit. For more information on Christie Lake Conservation Area or the Hamilton Conservation Authority please visit www.conservationhamilton.ca.\r\n","artists":[{"id":994,"name":"Feist","mbid":"a670e05a-cea8-4b37-bce9-d82daf1a0fa4","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6163244.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6163244.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Feist/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/feist","tracker_count":566160,"url":"Feist","website":"http://www.listentofeist.com"},{"id":27233,"name":"Emmylou
