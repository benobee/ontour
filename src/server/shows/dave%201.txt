For more than a decade, he and his Chromeo partner, Patrick Gemayel, have been making ultra-funk dance jams that are heavily saturated with synthesizers and reminiscent of the '80s. And yet, when the duo first started making music in the early '90s, hip-hop was what they listened to -- so hip-hop was what they made. \"I grew up with hip-hop,\" says Macklovitch, who met Gemayel at a private school in Montreal. \"Hip-hop was really a vehicle for us to discover music.\"\n\nOver the course of the last decade, the Chromeo guys have released four full-length records, one EP, 17 singles, and dozens of remixes. They've been interviewed by the New York Times and GQ. They've even designed a clothing line. And they're now bigger and better than ever, Macklovitch says, which is a feat, considering they've been around for so long.\n\nThough Chromeo has branched out in recent years to collaborate with artists such as Toro y Moi, Solange Knowles, A$AP Ferg, and Haim, the duo's sound has mostly remained the same: still cheeky and playful, still danceable, and still apparently using the same Pentium II computer from the '90s to produce some of their music.","artists":[{"id":3212604,"name":"Dave 1","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Dave1/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":297,"url":"Dave1","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Bardot","place":"Bardot","city":"Miami","region":"FL","country":"United States","latitude":25.809293,"longitude":-80.195584},"ontour_id":"fFSrKk6q4vu2238cC","genres":[]},{"id":13186799,"artist_id":3212604,"artist_event_id":16579682,"title":"Dave 1 @ Flash Factory in New York, NY","datetime":"2016-10-31T23:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Monday, October 31, 2016 at 11:00PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-10-24T12:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13186799?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dave+1&came_from=67","description":"Dave 1 (of Chromeo), Jesse Marco, Nick Catchdubs, NVM","artists":[{"id":3212604,"name":"Dave 1","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Dave1/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":297,"url":"Dave1","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Flash Factory","place":"Flash Factory","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.748055,"longitude":-73.994748},"ontour_id":"fFSrKk6q4vu2238cC","genres":[]}]
