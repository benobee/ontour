The band has been nominated for two 2012 Juno Awards (Best New Group and Video of the Year for their song Stamp), long listed for the 2011 Polaris Award, and awarded the CBC Music Prize for Best Independent Artist in 2014. \n\nThe RAA has released three albums on Saddle Creek/Paper Bag Records: Hometowns(2009), Departing (2011) and Mended With Gold (2014). The trio of Nils Edenloff, Paul Banwatt and Robin Hatch are currently hard at work on the band' s next album and will be previewing new material the way they love best, by hitting the road for a unique set of road testing shows in some of their favourite venues across North America and Europe through 2016/2017.","artists":[{"id":203313,"name":"The Rural Alberta Advantage","mbid":"e0647eee-82ce-40e6-af54-953395ad1c08","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6471961.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6471961.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheRuralAlbertaAdvantage/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ruralalberta","tracker_count":46627,"url":"TheRuralAlbertaAdvantage","website":"http://www.theraa.com;
