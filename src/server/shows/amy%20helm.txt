Hudson Valley-based and nationally know female vocalists Amy Helm, Ruth Ungar, Rebecca Martin, Elizabeth Mitchell, Rachel Loshak and the band Grenadilla will be performing. \r\n\r\nTickets are $15 for general admission. Advance tickets are available at http://anadooley.brownpapertickets.com/. \r\n\r\nThe concert is a benefit for the Dooley’s, an area family struggling with the serious illness of their eleven year-old daughter, Ana. (http://anadooley.com/). Musician Elizabeth Mitchell first conceived of the idea of bringing together female vocalists to honor Ana Dooley’s own powerful singing voice.\r\n\r\nDoors will open at 2:30 and the music will begin at 3:00. In addition to the music there will be a bake sale, raffle, t-shirt sales, and other items to purchase to raise funds for the Dooley family. Ana Dooley was diagnosed with a very rare cancer in August of 2012 and had a liver transplant in February of this year. The family is facing numerous expenses related to Ana’s illness which include monthly post-op care for Ana’s transplant, the cost of Ana’s many anti-rejection medications and travel to and from the hospital on a near weekly basis. \r\n\r\nIt was clear from a very early age that Ana Dooley had a natural gift for singing. At the age of six, she began voice and piano lessons with Debbie Lan, a local musician and leader of the band Grenadilla. She enjoys singing at school events and has performed at her school’s annual variety show every year since the age of eight. Ana also sang “Keep Holding On” by Avril Lavigne at the first concert in the Healing Ana concert series in November 2012. Her love of soulful, female singers was the inspiration for the concert.\r\nAll of the musicans, those working on sound and lighting and many other volunteers are giving 100% of their time for this community event. \r\n\r\nVolunteers are still needed – to volunteer for the event or donate to the raffle contact Janne Dooley at jannedooley@gmail.com.","artists":[{"id":91725,"name":"Amy

The evening is a fundraiser for two domestic violence shelters: The Washbourne House of Ulster County and Grace Smith House of Dutchess County.\r\n\r\nThroughout the evening speakers will give an overview of the scale and scope of domestic violence in both Dutchess and Ulster Counties, give personal accounts of victims, describe the shelter experience, and local and state-wide amelioration and prevention efforts. Speakers will include: Gwen Wright (Executive Director, NYS Office for The Prevention of Domestic Violence), Kathy Welby-Moretti (Director of The Washbourne House), Renee Fillette (Executive Director of Grace Smith House), Elizabeth Culmone (Ulster County Assistant District Attorney), Marjorie Smith (Bureau Chief, Dutchess County District Attorney). \r\n\r\nIn the mid-Hudson Valley, like the rest of the country, the numbers of extreme violence meted out by members of the same household are staggering. Each year in Ulster and Dutchess counties thousands of victims decide they’ve had enough and call police for help. Many thousands more are too scared, and never make the call. Each year hundreds of abusive perpetrators are arrested and dozens go to prison. And each year in our counties so-called “intimate partners” kill their partners. \r\n\r\nWithin a period of 15 months in Dutchess County six deaths were attributed to domestic violence. In the past five years, seven women in Ulster have paid the ultimate price, with their lives.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012 there were 3,200 domestic incident reports filed in Ulster County resulting in 567 arrests. In Dutchess County last year, 4,928 complaints were filed with police with 909 arrests. \r\n\r\nThese statistics combine for a bi-county total of 8,128 formal complaints last year, or an average of 677 per month, 156 each week, 22 a day. These shocking numbers only represent a fraction of the actual figures with an estimated fifty-five to ninety-five percent of domestic violence cases going unreported.\r\n\r\nAnd the numbers grow each year. “Often people want to point to the economy. Do people stress out more when they’re economically deprived, when they’ve lost their jobs, are unemployed? Yes, those are certainly risk factors for domestic violence, even homicide. But none of those things cause the violence. Violence is violence.”  \r\n\r\n—Renee Fillette, executive director of Grace Smith House in Poughkeepsie\r\n\r\n\"When we say domestic violence we’re talking about people who are either members of the same family or household. Girlfriend/boyfriend qualifies, though they don’t necessarily have to live together. They might be related by blood or marriage, have a child together, or might have been married to each other previously. The question really is was the assault made against someone you have an intimate relationship with. Same sex partners now fall under the definition, so the laws that protect heterosexual couples now protect homosexual couples, which is really important.\" \r\n\r\n—Elizabeth Culmone, Ulster County Assistant District Attorney\r\n\r\n“When we’re talking about women making the decision to come into shelter, to leave everything, someone who has been victimized, beaten, threatened, who’s been degraded to such an extent that the onus has been put on them that they have to leave their home and start their whole lives over again. These are the most courageous women I have ever known in my life.” \r\n\r\n—Kathy Welby-Moretti, director of The Washbourne House (Family of Woodstock).\r\n\r\n\"In February, at the Billion Rising event Kingston, I was confronted by a room full of life-size cardboard figures each with a sign that contained a woman's name, her age, hometown and the date she was murdered by her intimate partner. My heart stopped when I read the name of my town. In an instant I realized that the global issue of violence toward women was festering in my own neighborhood. Then I met Kathy from The Washbourne House domestic violence shelter and heard detailed accounts of terrorized women fleeing for their lives in the night with their children. How could this be happening in the idealized rural setting that is my home? I decided to help connect these families in crisis with the members of our community who have the privilege of living in peace and security.\"\r\n\r\n—Natalie Merchant\r\n\r\nSHELTER will feature vocal performances by several woman artists who are members of the Hudson Valley musical community. Amy Helm, the multi-instrumentalist and gifted singer of the band Ollabelle, keeps the proud Helm family musical legacy alive. Elizabeth Mitchell (with her husband Dan Littleton) has made three wonderful albums of children's music for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. They often perform original material under the band name \"Ida.\" Simi Stone, classically trained violinist and charismatic soul singer was born and raised in Ulster County where she has recently returned after years of performing and recording in New York City. Yungchen Lhamo is a world-renowned Tibetan Buddhist devotional singer who has made three albums for Peter Gabriel's label Real World and has recently made the Valley her home. The Kalmia Quartet is made up of four Bard Conservatory students, three of whom are brothers: violinists Shawn and Scot Moore, and cellist Stanley Moore, and violist Leah Gastler. Professor James Bagwell, director of Bard Conservatory of Music, will conduct the quartet. Additional musicians will include pianist Uri Sharlin, guitarist Gabriel Gordon, and bassist Jesse Murphy who have all performed with Merchant for over a decade.\r\n\r\nSHELTER is sponsored by Chronogram Magazine, Radio Woodstock 100.1, WKZE and made possible by the generosity and assistance of both The Bard Conservatory of Music and The Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts.","artists":[{"id":91725,"name":"Amy

Within in association with Music Without Borders presents The 34th Annual John Lennon Tribute.\r\n\r\nA joyous celebration of love, life and Lennon, this year's Tribute features one of best line-ups in its remarkable history: Debbie Harry (Blondie), Kate Pierson (The B-52s), David Johansen (The NY Dolls, Buster Poindexter) Joan Osborne, Amy Helm, Marshall Crenshaw, Ben E. King, Rich Pagano (Fab Faux), The Kennedys and Chrissi Poland. Plus, renowned rock photographer Bob Gruen, who chronicled John Lennon's years in New York City, will be honored.\r\n\r\n\"After all these years it's still a deeply moving night,\" says Tribute creator and MAD Magazine Senior Editor Joe Raiola, who will be appearing in the Tribute for the 34th consecutive year. \"John's music and message are timeless, and as relevant as ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tribute is a benefit for Theatre Within's John Lennon Real Love Project. Drawing upon John Lennon's song Real Love for its inspiration, this visionary program brings the healing power of music and creative expression to children in hospitals, schools and communities in-need.","artists":[{"id":91725,"name":"Amy Helm","mbid":"34a977be-ef17-4ab9-b34d-959a89e7e534","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8396608.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8396608.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AmyHelm/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/AmyHelmMusic","tracker_count":11066,"url":"AmyHelm","website":""},{"id":46431,"name":"Deborah Harry","mbid":"2e229823-0fc2-438b-aacb-5de02bd0b9b7","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeborahHarry/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":20912,"url":"DeborahHarry","website":"http://www.debbie-harry.net"},{"id":452103,"name":"Kate Pierson","mbid":"e7998c31-e46a-4daf-8f01-583fffccda1b","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KatePierson/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kate%20Pierson/180025558711843","tracker_count":11466,"url":"KatePierson","website":null},{"id":216232,"name":"David Johansen","mbid":"3cb2ba2a-81f9-49b6-8e9d-71dcf5fb56cc","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DavidJohansen/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":4706,"url":"DavidJohansen","website":null},{"id":11171,"name":"Joan Osborne","mbid":"746916c9-fd36-44e6-823d-03185e596f58","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JoanOsborne/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/joanosbornemusic/","tracker_count":55318,"url":"JoanOsborne","website":"http://www.joanosborne.com"},{"id":76205,"name":"Marshall Crenshaw","mbid":"3a389027-814a-4f99-8f12-44e5276595cf","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MarshallCrenshaw/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/MarshallCrenshawOfficial","tracker_count":19510,"url":"MarshallCrenshaw","website":null},{"id":46766,"name":"Ben E.
