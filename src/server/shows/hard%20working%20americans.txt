us for a screening of director Justin Kreutzmann’s insightful, copacetic-minded snapshot of Hard Working Americans, a fertile new collaboration for battered-but-unbroken hippy musical lifers Todd Snider, Dave Schools (Widespread Panic), Neal Casal (The Cardinals, Chris Robinson Brotherhood), Chad Staehly (Great American Taxi), Duane Trucks (Col. Bruce Hapton’s School of Music) and Jesse Aycock. Mixing intimate concert performances, road scenes, personal tales, and studio footage, The First Waltz arrives at a crucial moment to remind us that Jerry Garcia is as important as Ben Franklin and that rock ‘n’ roll is as much a birthright as The Constitution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA Q&A with director Justin Kreutzmann and the band (minus Casal), hosted by Nashville Scene managing editor Jack

length rockumentary film + live album soundtrack.\r\n\r\nWhat begins with a creaky rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner” and the firing of a freshly rolled number unfolds into a multilayered examination of what it means to be American. Director Justin Kreutzmann brings us an insightful, copacetic-minded snapshot of this fertile new collaboration for battered-but-unbroken hippy musical lifers Todd Snider, Dave Schools, Neal Casal, Chad Staehly, Duane Trucks and Jesse Aycock. Mixing intimate concert performances, road scenes, personal tales, and studio footage, The First Waltz arrives at a crucial moment to remind us that Jerry Garcia is as important as Ben Franklin and that rock ‘n’ roll is as much a birthright as The Constitution.","artists":[{"id":8808806,"name":"Hard Working

Memorial Day Concert to Celebrate New Record, 'Rest in Chaos,' and Support Charity\n\nTwo weeks after Hard Working Americans' 'Rest in Chaos' hits stores, the \"gritty, greasy rock & roll\" ensemble (Rolling Stone Country) will throw a hometown album-release block party in downtown Nashville on Monday, May 30th. \n\nThe free Memorial Day concert will shine a light on the blend of blues, Southern soul and rule-breaking rock bandmates Todd Snider, Dave Schools, Neal Casal, Duane Trucks, Chad Staehly, and Jesse Aycock dish up with their diverse second album. Equally diverse is the roster of other bands on the bill, including Leftover Salmon, Tim O'Brien+Nick Forster+Bryan Sutton, Sparkle City DJs, Rorey Carroll, and Sophia Scott. Kicking off at 2 p.m. and continuing until 8:30 p.m., the event will bring music, a free photo booth, and kid-friendly games to the corner of Broadway and 1st Ave., directly in front of the Acme Feed & Seed honky-tonk. \n\nPresented by Nashville's Lightning 100 radio station, Hard Working Americans' album-release block party doubles as an awareness event and fundraiser for Blood:Water, an organization that looks to mitigate the HIV and water crises in Africa. \n\nRun of show:\n1:30 p.m.: Doors Open\n2-2:30 p.m.: Sophia Scott\n2:30-3:00 p.m.: Rorey Carroll \n3:15-3:45 p.m.: Tim O'Brien+Nick Forster+Bryan Sutton\n3:45-4:15 p.m.: Sparkle City DJs\n4:15-5:30 p.m.: Leftover Salmon\n5:30-6:00 p.m.: Sparkle City DJs\n6:00-8:00 p.m.: Hard Working Americans : 6:00-8:00 pm\n8:00-8:30 p.m.: Sparkle City DJs\n\nFollow Hard Working Americans: \nOfficial Website: thehardworkingamericans.com \nFacebook: facebook.com/hardworkingamericans \nTwitter: twitter.com/hwamericans Instagram: instagram.com/hwamericans \nYouTube: youtube.com/user/hwamericans\n\nFollow other block-party artists here:\nLeftover Salmon: www.leftoversalmon.com\nTim O'Brien+Nick Forster+Bryan Sutton: www.hotrize.com \nSparkle City DJs: https://www.facebook.com/SparkleCityDJs/\nRorey Caroll: www.roreycarroll.com \nSophia Scott: https://www.facebook.com/sophiascottmusic/\n","artists":[{"id":8808806,"name":"Hard Working Americans","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8246273.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8246273.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HardWorkingAmericans/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/HardWorkingAmericans","tracker_count":31511,"url":"HardWorkingAmericans","website":null},{"id":46816,"name":"Leftover Salmon","mbid":"3020be1d-3c41-4e42-911b-ca5e96489300","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/LeftoverSalmon/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/leftoversalmon","tracker_count":57629,"url":"LeftoverSalmon","website":"http://www.leftoversalmon.com/salmon/"},{"id":13447391,"name":"Tim O'Brien+Nick Forster+Bryan Sutton","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TimO%27brienplusnickForsterplusbryanSutton/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"TimO'brienplusnickForsterplusbryanSutton","website":null},{"id":1577875,"name":"Rorey Carroll","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/RoreyCarroll/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":1548,"url":"RoreyCarroll","website":null},{"id":10636941,"name":"Sophia Scott","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SophiaScott/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":672,"url":"SophiaScott","website":null},{"id":8808806,"name":"Hard Working Americans","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HardWorkingAmericans/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/HardWorkingAmericans","tracker_count":31511,"url":"HardWorkingAmericans","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"FREE \"Rest In Chaos\" Album Release Block Party","place":"Acme Feed & Seed","city":"Nashville","region":"TN","country":"United States","latitude":36.1618729,"longitude":-86.7743225},"ontour_id":"LpK47mPqz5TLDLkdE","genres":["new americana"]},{"id":11846525,"artist_id":8808806,"artist_event_id":14764861,"title":"Hard Working Americans @ ARISE Music Festival in Loveland, CO","datetime":"2016-08-05T12:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:00PM","formatted_location":"Loveland, CO","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11846525?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Hard+Working+Americans&came_from=67","description":"ARISE is a 3-day music, yoga, activism and co-creative camping festival featuring an exciting lineup of conscious musical artists, provocative films, dynamic speakers, awe-inspiring art installations, heart-opening yoga classes, interactive workshops, performance artists, and an acclaimed art gallery.
