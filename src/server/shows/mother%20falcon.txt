we head into the fourth year of Mother Falcon's Music Lab, we are more committed than ever to insuring economic and social diversity among attendees.  To help make that possible, last year we started the Margaret Moser Maternal Music Fund.  Named after the legendary music journalist who gave us our first press coverage, thereby validating this crazy idea of being a full orchestra playing rock clubs.  Without Margaret's support it's questionable whether we would have gone on to make albums and tour across the country, let alone stick it out in the local scene.  \n\n100% of proceeds from this show and any donations to the MMMMF go to paying tuition for students to attend Mother Falcon's Music Lab.  Last year, the first year of the fund, nearly half the attendees at our camp received full or partial scholarships.  \n\nThis event will include a set by Mother Falcon, performances by former Music Lab attendee's plus special guests.  Tickets are sliding scale, so you can contribute as much or little as you like to the scholarship fund, though we have set a $10 minimum.\n\n\nALL AGES SHOW","artists":[{"id":973440,"name":"Mother
