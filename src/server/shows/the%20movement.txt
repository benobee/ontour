Joshua Swain, Jordan Miller, and John Ruff, aka DJ Riggles, launched The Movement with their \"alternative reggae\" debut album, \"On Your Feet.\" In 2008, the group met Chris DiBeneditto, a Philadelphia-based producer who had worked with like-minded acts such as Slightly Stoopid and G. Love & Special Sauce. Relocating to Philadelphia, they recorded 2008's \"Set Sail\" at DiBeneditto’s Philadelphonic Studios. The album has sold over 10,000 copies to date. The Movement expanded with the addition of Gary Jackson on drums and Jason \"Smiles\" Schmidt on bass. In 2012, Miller left the group, and the trio, now fronted by Swain, released their fourth album \"Side By Side,\" debuting at #2 on the Billboard Reggae Chart. In early 2014, DJ-producer Alific joined the band, returning scratching and samples to The Movement's live show. \r\n\r\nhttp://Facebook.com/themovementvibe \r\nhttp://Twitter.com/themovementvibe \r\nhttp://Instagram.com/themovementvibe \r\nhttp://Youtube.com/themovementvibe","artists":[{"id":9252,"name":"The Movement","mbid":"0a440d3e-40af-4f82-a986-87a6fcf4a0e9","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8431040.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8431040.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheMovement/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/themovementvibe","tracker_count":46473,"url":"TheMovement","website":"http://www.insidethemovement.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Seacrets (Free)","place":"Seacrets","city":"Ocean City","region":"MD","country":"United States","latitude":38.374511,"longitude":-75.070047},"ontour_id":"ZZYEXsB5Cawue8zxZ","genres":["reggae rock"]},{"id":8319264,"artist_id":9252,"artist_event_id":9582538,"title":"The Movement @ The Pit (21+) in Kill Devil Hills, NC","datetime":"2014-07-22T22:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, July 22, 2014 at 10:00PM","formatted_location":"Kill Devil Hills, NC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/8319264?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Movement&came_from=67","description":"21+ $10\r\nhttp://pitsurf.com 252-480-3128\r\n\r\nhttp://TheMovementVibe.com\r\n\r\nNew album \"Side By Side\" out now! iTunes https://itun.es/i6xn463\r\n\r\nHailing from Columbia, South Carolina, the reggae-rock group The Movement was formed in 2004 by a trio of Sublime and Pixies fans.

https://itun.es/i6xn463 \r\n\r\nHailing from Columbia, South Carolina, the reggae-rock group The Movement was formed in 2004 by a trio of Sublime and Pixies fans. Joshua Swain, Jordan Miller, and John Ruff, aka DJ Riggles, launched The Movement with their \"alternative reggae\" debut album, \"On Your Feet.\" In 2008, the group met Chris DiBeneditto, a Philadelphia-based producer who had worked with like-minded acts such as Slightly Stoopid and G. Love & Special Sauce. Relocating to Philadelphia, they recorded 2008's \"Set Sail\" at DiBeneditto’s Philadelphonic Studios. The album has sold over 10,000 copies to date. The Movement expanded with the addition of Gary Jackson on drums and Jason \"Smiles\" Schmidt on bass. In 2012, Miller left the group, and the trio, now fronted by Swain, released their fourth album \"Side By Side,\" debuting at #2 on the Billboard Reggae Chart.
