Spend an evening with the show’s lead character, the hapless Janitor of the Eiffel Tower - played by Koster - who will attempt, and fail, to clean this very venue, as surreal events, songs (by the Music Tapes), and magic simply happen all around him (and you). Debuting in the top ten on iTunes’ podcast charts, the podcast - a combination of cinematic audio narrative, song, and sound collage - has reached a loving cult fandom all over the world, has been featured in The New York Times, Pitchfork, and Spin, and was named one of The Guardian’s top podcasts of 2016.\r\nAbout the Music Tapes: Founded by Koster and Robbie Cucchiaro, the Music Tapes, seminal members of the beloved Elephant 6 Collective, are known for creating unique and extraordinary live events. Their most recent show, 2012’s The Traveling Imaginary, toured in a circus tent with its own carnival of surreal games. This tour, in support of Merge Records’ release of the new Orbiting Human Circus EP - a collection of songs from the podcast and the Music Tapes’ sixth release on the revered indie label - might be the Music Tapes’ most ambitious offering to date.\r\nTICKET INFORMATION  • Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue. • No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.
