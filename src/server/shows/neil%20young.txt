on sale Friday, 8/21 at 10AM.\nTix link: http://nedcon.co/1NDws2k\n\nNeil Young + Promise of the Real have confirmed a second leg of the Rebel Content Tour which will include a stop at the Santa Barbara Bowl on Saturday, October 10 at 6:30 PM.\n\nThe Rebel Content Tour presents Neil Young + Promise of the Real – Lukas Nelson (vocals/guitar), along with Micah Nelson (guitar, vocals), Anthony Logerfo (drums), Corey McCormick (bass/vocals) and Tato Melgar (percussion). Neil and Promise of the Real played together at the Bold Nebraska /Cowboys and Indians Alliance event last year along with Lukas and Micah’s father Willie Nelson. They had such an instant synergy that Neil invited them to record his new album The Monsanto Years with him.\n\nThe first leg of the Rebel Content Tour has drawn a truly overwhelming response to Young + Promise of The Real’s amazing energy. Ranging from solo acoustic, to full band acoustic, to full on raging rock jams these 2-to-3 hour, ever changing “dream set lists” feature material from both The Monsanto Years and Young’s entire catalogue and have left audiences enthralled.\n\n“The ever-evolving ruby in the dust is back this summer, playing a mix of old and new songs with an enthusiastic backing band that includes the sons of the legendary Willie Nelson. The group unleashed a blistering 22+ song set that had a little something for everybody. Unlike those of some of his contemporaries a Neil Young concert never feels like a “greatest hits” money grab. Even when he’s playing his classics, he invests them with the same passion and intensity that has drawn fans to him throughout his long career.” — Relix\n\n“The show started out folkie and familiar and grew in electric intensity and volume as the evening proceeded. Young let the music do the talking. The musicians acquitted themselves with garage-band raggedness and youthful enthusiasm. Young still remains a commanding and often electrifying performer, one of the great instinctual rock artists and guitarists of all time.” – The Boston Globe\n\n“The band plays like a younger, scrappier version of Young’s own Crazy Horse. Young’s ragged and lived in, his voice a haunting yowl that’s only grown more honest with age. He wears his rust well.” – Detroit News\n\n“Young is incapable of giving a bad performance simply because he’s so committed to his music and his unique tenor voice is in fine form.” – New Jersey Herald.\n\n“Young has been sounding the alarm about environmental issues for more than four decades now. He’s warned us…That kind of honesty has been at the heart of his music. It’s the warts-and-all passion that inspires us to hang with Young down any road he wanders.” – Rolling Stone\nOnce again, “Neil’s Village ” an alliance of regional grassroots organizations, advocates and national non-profits will join this leg of the Rebel Content Tour. “Neil’s Village” will be set up on concourse level at each of the venues and will engage attendees in sharing issues of sustainability and action.\nFUTURE OF FARMING TENT:\nFocusing on the regenerative power of soil in bioremediation and carbon sequestration and for federal policy reform to advance the sustainability of agriculture, food systems, natural resources, and rural communities.\n\nEARTH ECOLOGY TENT:\nFocusing on biodiversity and how the welfare of human beings is deeply linked to nature and the diversity of wild plants and animals.\n\nBAN GMO TENT:\nGMO free advocates for sustainable food and ecological systems, supporting the people’s right to know what’s in their food and supporting the right for all people to have access to clean food and water.\n\nFREEDOM & JUSTICE TENT:\nCollective coalitions of individuals committed to working together to end corporate personhood, the prioritizing of corporations over people and taking a stand for true democracy.\n\nENERGY & CLIMATE TENT:\nProviding “solutions” to climate change, information about actions and promoting social justice as inextricably linked to a healthy environment\n\nNEWS YOU CAN TRUST TENT:\nThe ultimate newsstand to peruse, turning people on to news publications they actually can trust.\n\nPONO TENT:\nWhile Pono, Neil’s hi Res music player and music provider, doesn’t directly relate to sustainability, it does relate to quality of life. Pono players will be available for concertgoers to hear the difference for themselves and Pono representatives will be on hand to explain the player’s features.\n\nwww.sbbowl.com","artists":[{"id":1343,"name":"Neil

Percival Young, \r\n\r\nis a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. He began performing in a group covering Shadows instrumentals in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield together with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969. He released his first album in 1968 and has since forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, spanning over 45 years and 35 studio albums, with a continuous and uncompromizing exploration of musical styles.[6] The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as ”one of rock and roll´s greatest songwriters and performers”. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice, first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\r\n\r\nYoung´s music is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and characteristic alto or high tenor singing voice.Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound.\r\n\r\nWhile Young has experimented with differing music styles throughout a varied career, including electronic music, most of his best known work is either acoustic folk-rock and country rock or electric, amplified hard rock (most often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Musical styles such as alternative rock and grunge also adopted elements from Young. His influence has caused some to dub him the ”Godfather of Grunge”","artists":[{"id":1343,"name":"Neil
