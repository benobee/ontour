has seen miles & miles of Texas. They got their kicks on Route 66. And, in 2010, the band clicked another milestone on the odometer– their 40th anniversary. Now in their 45th year, the band continues to introduce the western swing genre to a new generation. It all started when Ray Benson, Floyd Domino, and Lucky Oceans, along with a Vermont farm boy named Leroy Preston; Virginian Chris O'Connell; and Gene Dobkin, a bass player & fellow classmate of Benson's from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, joined forces. They began with a simple goal: to play & help revive American roots music.","artists":[{"id":10346,"name":"Asleep at the
