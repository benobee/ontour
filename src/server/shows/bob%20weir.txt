after the Sundance premiere of Martian Scorsese’s Long Strange Trip and the announcement of a May tour for Dead & Company. But before Bob Weir sets out on the road with former Dead members Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, he’ll be cruising through the South to support his latest solo album, 2016’s Blue Mountain. Working with famed Americana singer-songwriter Josh Ritter and assorted members of The National, Weir’s album is a reboot for the 69-year-old guitarist. Sporting a more grizzled voice after decades of experience playing with the Grateful Dead, Weir seems to have toned down the psychedelic soundscapes of his past work, opting for a cavernous country vibe loaded with clever allusions and analogies to cowboy culture. The Campfire Band, comprised of the aforementioned members of The National as well as RatDog guitarist Steve Kimock, helped with the recording of Blue Mountain and will back Weir throughout his solo tour as well. Seeing as Dead & Company won’t be passing through Dallas during their tour, this is the best chance Dallas Deadheads will get to see Weir in action.","artists":[{"id":104892,"name":"Bob Weir","mbid":"c8a63580-9e6b-4852-bf93-c09760035e76","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7830423.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7830423.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BobWeir/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/BobbyWeir/","tracker_count":122690,"url":"BobWeir","website":"http://www.rat-dog.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Music Hall At Fair Park","place":"Music Hall At Fair Park","city":"Dallas","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":32.780979,"longitude":-96.765935},"ontour_id":"zPJjP7KyatE7YysrD","genres":["jam band","modern blues","roots rock","southern rock"]},{"id":13765258,"artist_id":104892,"artist_event_id":17409525,"title":"Bob Weir @ Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater in Austin, TX","datetime":"2017-04-15T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, April 15, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Austin, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-01-27T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13765258?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Bob+Weir&came_from=67","description":"BOB WEIR & THE CAMPFIRE BAND","artists":[{"id":104892,"name":"Bob Weir","mbid":"c8a63580-9e6b-4852-bf93-c09760035e76","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7830423.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7830423.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BobWeir/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/BobbyWeir/","tracker_count":122690,"url":"BobWeir","website":"http://www.rat-dog.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater","place":"Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater","city":"Austin","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":30.26512,"longitude":-97.746963},"ontour_id":"zPJjP7KyatE7YysrD","genres":["jam band","modern blues","roots rock","southern rock"]},{"id":13765271,"artist_id":104892,"artist_event_id":17409538,"title":"Bob Weir @ Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater in Austin, TX","datetime":"2017-04-16T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, April 16, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Austin, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-01-27T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13765271?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Bob+Weir&came_from=67","description":"BOB WEIR & THE CAMPFIRE BAND","artists":[{"id":104892,"name":"Bob Weir","mbid":"c8a63580-9e6b-4852-bf93-c09760035e76","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7830423.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7830423.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BobWeir/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/BobbyWeir/","tracker_count":122690,"url":"BobWeir","website":"http://www.rat-dog.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater","place":"Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater","city":"Austin","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":30.26512,"longitude":-97.746963},"ontour_id":"zPJjP7KyatE7YysrD","genres":["jam band","modern blues","roots rock","southern rock"]},{"id":13764537,"artist_id":104892,"artist_event_id":17408480,"title":"Bob Weir @ Saenger Theatre New Orleans in New Orleans, LA","datetime":"2017-04-18T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, April 18, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"New Orleans, LA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-01-27T16:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13764537?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Bob+Weir&came_from=67","description":"SPECIAL OFFER!
