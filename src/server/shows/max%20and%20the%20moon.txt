The basement of the historic Pershing Square Building has been crafted into a new hidden gem in Downtown Los Angeles. After passing through an unassuming pair of black double doors, you descend down an ornate iron staircase and are embraced by a 5,500 gallon chandelier brimming with sea life. The suspended aquarium illuminates the architecturally stunning space, submerging you into an edgy and glamorous world. It becomes immediately clear that this is not your average venue. Simultaneously spacious and intimate, the scene creates a perfect acoustic environment to indulge in eccentric yet balanced drinks paired with a decadent menu featuring caviar varietals.","artists":[{"id":1490697,"name":"Max and the
