oh-oh-eye-oh-oh), is the namesake for the Flaming Lips' eccentric and epic 2002 album, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. She was also a percussionist with the Japanese avant-noise outfit Boredoms and has collaborated with the likes of Kim Gordon and Sean Lennon. OOIOO, making its local debut Thursday, at its core is four Japanese women who explore the outer limits where pop and experimental music converge. Over nearly two decades and a half-dozen or so albums, the group has dabbled in minimalism, psychedelia, no wave, quirky hooks, peculiar effects, odd instrumentation, and shards of jazz and prog rock. That cocktail of sounds has yielded textural soundscapes that at their best are surreal, playful, and weirdly wonderful. The group took a different tack on its latest album, 2014's Gamel, fusing its many eclectic elements with traditional Javanese gamelan percussion. Morphing through multiple dimensions prompted by everything from electric guitars to ritual-style chanting, it celebrates the juxtaposition of chaos and precision, ancient and modern. Sumunar Gamelan Ensemble opens.","artists":[{"id":61718,"name":"OOIOO","mbid":"8ee72e86-d75b-4e18-9116-41a10ff92703","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/4154209.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/4154209.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/OOIOO/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":3239,"url":"OOIOO","website":"http://ooioo.jp/"}],"venue":{"name":"Walker

has always created a musical language all its own. Under the leadership of Yoshimi, also a founding member of Boredoms, the group has recorded six albums that have subverted expectations and warped perceptions of what constitutes pop and experimental music. Four years of work went into to making Gamel, their bold new album inspired by the Javanese style of gamelan and the first new music from Yoshimi in over five years. Gamelan is an ancient form that has inspired a great many composers and musicians over the past century, from Erik Satie and Claude Debussy to Mouse on Mars and Sun City Girls. The introduction of this traditional form transformed the group into a super tribe, side-stepping the road between the past and the future. Their focus is not to replicate these ancient styles, but to incorporate them into their consistently inventive, constantly shifting musical frameworks. They take their love of indigenous music into an entirely new dimension by freely weaving organic and electric tones into a vivid tapestry, employing their keen sense of color and texture.\n\nWhile previous OOIOO albums have been largely studio creations, Gamel is the most accurate portrayal of the band's overwhelming, forceful live presence they have released yet. Yoshimi leads her minimalistic rhythm ensemble by making quick, impulsive shifts in tone and attack, the group acting as one mind under her expert instruction. While the gamelan elements will be brand new to many listeners, the band offsets the bizarre with familiar, at times even nostalgic and childlike, melodies. Gamel is euphoric, bursting at the seams with an exhilarating frenzy that is universal yet uniquely their own. OOIOO's music is reflected in the ear of the beholder, with each listener taking away something different.\n\nYoshimi began her music career in 1986 playing drums in UFO or Die with vocalist Eye, and later joined him in the revolutionary noise-pop group Boredoms. Her explosive drum performances captivated audiences and even inspired Wayne Coyne to name a now-famous Flaming Lips album in her honor.

Under the leadership of Yoshimi, also a founding member of Boredoms, the group has recorded six albums that have subverted expectations and warped perceptions of what constitutes pop and experimental music. Four years of work went into to making Gamel, their bold new album inspired by the Javanese style of gamelan and the first new music from Yoshimi in over five years. Gamelan is an ancient form that has inspired a great many composers and musicians over the past century, from Erik Satie and Claude Debussy to Mouse on Mars and Sun City Girls. The introduction of this traditional form transformed the group into a super tribe, side-stepping the road between the past and the future. Their focus is not to replicate these ancient styles, but to incorporate them into their consistently inventive, constantly shifting musical frameworks. They take their love of indigenous music into an entirely new dimension by freely weaving organic and electric tones into a vivid tapestry, employing their keen sense of color and texture.\n\nWhile previous OOIOO albums have been largely studio creations, Gamel is the most accurate portrayal of the band's overwhelming, forceful live presence they have released yet. Yoshimi leads her minimalistic rhythm ensemble by making quick, impulsive shifts in tone and attack, the group acting as one mind under her expert instruction. While the gamelan elements will be brand new to many listeners, the band offsets the bizarre with familiar, at times even nostalgic and childlike, melodies. Gamel is euphoric, bursting at the seams with an exhilarating frenzy that is universal yet uniquely their own. OOIOO's music is reflected in the ear of the beholder, with each listener taking away something different.\n\nYoshimi began her music career in 1986 playing drums in UFO or Die with vocalist Eye, and later joined him in the revolutionary noise-pop group Boredoms.
