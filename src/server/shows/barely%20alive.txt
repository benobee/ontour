What started as a fun experiment, quickly turned into an outdoor concert of hundreds upon hundreds of people...\r\n\r\nSince then, Project Drop has gone on to work with some of the biggest names in the EDM industry and continues to grow with every show. Staying true to the area where it all began, we are hosting our 2nd Anniversary Party in Northampton MA.\r\n\r\nDODGE & FUSKI\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/dodgeandfuski\r\n\r\nDodge & Fuski are two chaps that have firmly found their feet in the bass music scene, with a skill for switching genres and varying bpm’s throughout their sets. Since the beginning of 2011 the dubstep and drumstep duo racked up millions of views on Youtube and been championed by Radio 1, 1 Xtra and the world’s leading YouTube dubstep channel UKF.\r\n\r\nThe Bristol duo have just launched their own label 'Disciple Recordings', in partnership with legendary label ‘Never Say Die Records’ home to artists such as Foreign Beggars, Zomboy, 501, SKisM and more. After the release of their debut EP ‘Come Again’ their DJ bookings tripled over night and had them playing regularly around Europe, Australia, New Zealand, The United States & Canada.\r\n\r\nKENNEDY JONES\r\nwww.Soundcloud.com/KennedyJones\r\n\r\nHailing from Southern California, Kennedy Jones is no stranger to bass music stages in the United States. Having had great success with his prior collaborative project which was predominantly Dubstep oriented, his last release with the duo was signed to Ultra Records. Having been a musician as long as he can remember and a need for a solo project, the \"Kennedy Jones\" project was born taking the trapstyle bass music scene by storm. With support from artists such as Borgore, 12th Planet, Major Lazer, Carnage, Mt Eden, Nadastrom, Bro Safari, Brillz, Luminox, Ookay, and more, he has proved already that his high energy bass-packed tunes can rock dance floors across the world.\r\n\r\nSURPRISE GUESTS\r\nWe cannot say who these two performers will be, but we can say that they are both internationally touring DJs with huge respective followings of their own...\r\n\r\nBARELY ALIVE:\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/barelyalive","artists":[{"id":1519791,"name":"Barely Alive","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8073413.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8073413.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BarelyAlive/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/barelyalivemusic","tracker_count":38113,"url":"BarelyAlive","website":null},{"id":2253396,"name":"Kicks n Licks","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KicksNLicks/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KnLDub","tracker_count":10961,"url":"KicksNLicks","website":null},{"id":1957916,"name":"MitiS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MitiS/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Mitismusic","tracker_count":52336,"url":"MitiS","website":null},{"id":5203799,"name":"Kennedy Jones","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KennedyJones/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/kennedyjones","tracker_count":37389,"url":"KennedyJones","website":null},{"id":1056222,"name":"Dodge & Fuski","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DodgeAndFuski/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/dodgeandfuski","tracker_count":50531,"url":"DodgeAndFuski","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"DIVA'S NIGHTCLUB","place":"DIVA'S NIGHTCLUB","city":"Northampton","region":"MA","country":"United States","latitude":42.311981,"longitude":-72.624367},"ontour_id":"yb4mnZAW96SmRXwTu","genres":["catstep","zapstep"]},{"id":7105163,"artist_id":1519791,"artist_event_id":7779387,"title":"Barely Alive @ DIVA'S NIGHTCLUB in Northampton, MA","datetime":"2013-10-18T21:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, October 18, 2013 at 9:30PM","formatted_location":"Northampton, MA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/7105163?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Barely+Alive&came_from=67","description":"Project Drop Presents RL Grime at Diva's Nightclub\r\n\r\nCome see us perform with RL Grime and Odd Job!\r\n\r\nRL Grime: \r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rlgrime\r\nOdd Job: \r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/odd-job-official","artists":[{"id":1519791,"name":"Barely Alive","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8073413.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8073413.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BarelyAlive/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/barelyalivemusic","tracker_count":38113,"url":"BarelyAlive","website":null},{"id":1078174,"name":"Odd Job","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/OddJob/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":241,"url":"OddJob","website":null},{"id":1394285,"name":"RL Grime","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/RlGrime/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/RLGrime","tracker_count":210399,"url":"RlGrime","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"DIVA'S NIGHTCLUB","place":"DIVA'S NIGHTCLUB","city":"Northampton","region":"MA","country":"United States","latitude":42.311981,"longitude":-72.624367},"ontour_id":"yb4mnZAW96SmRXwTu","genres":["catstep","zapstep"]},{"id":7995881,"artist_id":1519791,"artist_event_id":9074659,"title":"Barely Alive @ MCLA Presents: Rock The Block!

Get ready for Barely Alive coming to Effex !  21+ $10 Cover   Barely Alive https://soundcloud.com/barelyalive  With countless Beatport number 1's, tens of millions of hits on Soundcloud & Youtube, collaborations with Datsik, Getter, Dodge & Fuski, Astronaut, remixes for Destroid, Zomboy, Virtual Riot, Eptic, 501 and more under their belt, few can deny that Barely Alive are one of the most exciting and fastest grow-ing bass music acts to emerge over the last 18 months. The duo from Massachusetts, USA initially made a name for themselves when they released their debut 'Lost In The Internet' EP through Disciple Recordings in late February 2014 to global acclaim, hitting the number one spot across four different genre charts on Beatport in just 24 hours, causing them to become an over night success. The touring soon followed with the guys also gaining regular DJ support from the likes of Skrillex, Datsik, Excision, Zomboy, Skism and Downlink (to name a few!) as well as making regular appearances on huge online music platforms such as UKF, EDM.com, Your EDM, This Song Is Sick and most recently a guest mix for the infamous BBC Radio 1. 18 months since the first release, Barely Alive are about to unleash their debut album titled 'We Are Barely Alive' onto the world through Disciple and have fully established themselves as a headline act.  With Support From.. Patty Imparadise CAMAND b2b SYDAFKT LANK  We will also be having Fusion Flow Arts Perform !   Please be responisble ! If it can harm or hurt someone, leave it at home!

social media interaction, and collaborations and remixes for Zomboy, Datsik, SKisM, Excision, Destroid, Astronaut, Getter and more under their belt, few can deny that Barely Alive are one of the most exciting and fastest growing bass music acts to emerge over the last year.The duo originating from Massachusetts, USA initially made a name for themselves when they released their debut EP through Disciple Recordings in early 2014 to global acclaim, hitting the number one spot across 4 different genre charts on Beatport in just 24 hours. This made Barely Alive an over night success, and to this date they have been labelled just under Skrillex as the second hottest dubstep artists of 2014 on Beatport.International touring soon followed across the United States, Europe and the rest of the world, with Barely Alive making up one of the core artists of the Disciple Alliance tours, the Datsik Ninja Nation tour along side Trolley Snatcha and Kennedy Jones, and multiple headline tours in Australia, New Zealand, France and more. They have received regular DJ support from acts such as Skrillex, Datsik, Excision, Far Too Loud and Zomboy, as well as making regular appearances on huge online music platforms such as UKF, EDM.com, NEST HQ, This Song Is Sick, and a guest mix for the renowned BBC Radio 1.This is just the start for Barely Alive, who within their first year at Disciple found themselves well on their way to becoming a future headline act.","artists":[{"id":1519791,"name":"Barely Alive","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8073413.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8073413.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BarelyAlive/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/barelyalivemusic","tracker_count":38113,"url":"BarelyAlive","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Tempt Murfreesboro","place":"Tempt Murfreesboro","city":"Murfreesboro","region":"TN","country":"United States","latitude":35.8460757,"longitude":-86.3933517},"ontour_id":"yb4mnZAW96SmRXwTu","genres":["catstep","zapstep"]},{"id":12946364,"artist_id":1519791,"artist_event_id":16251888,"title":"Barely Alive @ Gallatin County Fairgrounds in Bozeman, MT","datetime":"2016-10-29T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 29, 2016 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Bozeman, MT","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12946364?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Barely+Alive&came_from=67","description":"WARNING!

Camp Presents - Basement Dwellers 2017 Tour on Saturday, October 20th\nBarely Alive - \n\n\nWith 5 consecutive Beatport number 1s, over six million streams in the last 12 months off the back of their lively social media interaction, and collaborations and remixes for Zomboy, Datsik, SKisM, Excision, Destroid, Astronaut, Getter and more under their belt, few can deny that Barely Alive is one of the most exciting and fastest growing bass music acts to emerge over the last year.The duo originating from Massachusetts, USA initially made a name for themselves when they released their debut EP through Disciple Recordings in early 2014 to global acclaim, hitting the number one spot across 4 different genre charts on Beatport in just 24 hours. This made Barely Alive an over night success, and to this date, they have been labeled just under Skrillex as the second hottest dubstep artists of 2014 on Beatport.International touring soon followed across the United States, Europe and the rest of the world, with Barely Alive making up one of the core artists of the Disciple Alliance tours, the Datsik Ninja Nation tour along side Trolley Snatcha and Kennedy Jones, and multiple headline tours in Australia, New Zealand, France and more. They have received regular DJ support from acts such as Skrillex, Datsik, Excision, Far Too Loud and Zomboy, as well as making regular appearances on huge online music platforms such as UKF, EDM.com, NEST HQ, This Song Is Sick, and a guest mix for the renowned BBC Radio 1.This is just the start for Barely Alive, who within their first year at Disciple found themselves well on their way to becoming a future headline act.\n\nVirtual Riots - \n is a German DJ and electronic music producer.  At the age of 22, he has released several albums and EPs, most notably his 2013 album, \"There Goes Your Money.\" He was signed to the independent music label Disciple Recordings in 2014.[1]\nHe has had numerous Beatport chart hits including \"One For All, All For One\" with Razihel and \"Cali Born\" with Helicopter Showdown.[2]\nOther electronic music outlets, like YourEDM, have called his music \"non-traditional\" and \"edgy,\" comparing him to artists like Savant.[3]\nBrunn has amassed over 218,000 followers on SoundCloud and is increasing rapidly, where he has released many tracks, beginning with a rock-pop piece entitled \"Wake Me Up\", and recently, his EP 'Throwback'.
