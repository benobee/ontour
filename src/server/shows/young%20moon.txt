But in her teens, paralyzed by stage fright when she got up to perform with her guitar, she began writing about music instead. In 1977 she moved to Los Angeles to be the US correspondent for leading UK rock magazine Sounds, and then almost every major music publication you can name. She interviewed everyone from Michael Jackson to Metallica; went on the road with bands including Black Sabbath, Motley Crue and The Clash; and wrote album liner-notes for artists inclluding Johnny Cash, with whom she spent a week at his Tennessee home, conducting the last interviews he gave before his death. She has written for just about every major music publication you can name.\nMoving back to London, she became UK correspondent for the legendary Creem and later a founding writer of MOJO magazine, and ha made frequent appearances on radio and TV music shows. She has also lived in France. She currently lives in San Francisco.\nIn 2012, with the publication of I'm Your Man: The Life Of Leonard Cohen Sylvie embarked on an epic, unorthodox book tour. She went across the world with her book and a ukulele - US, UK, Germany, Canada, New Zealand and Australia - talking about Cohen and singing his songs. These shows took on a life of their own, with different guest musicians accompanying her along the way. As the stage fright disappeared, she began accepting offers to sing her own songs. In 2014 she went into Wavelab Studio in Tucson, AZ with Howe Gelb/Giant Sand and recorded them live to tape. Light In The Attic Records heard of them and signed her, making Sylvie the first debut artist on the label.\nSince Sylvie's release in October 2014, she has been performing in the US, Europe and S. America.\n----------------\nSome praise for Sylvie's work:\nSylvie (album)\n“Fragile and fearless, direct and poetic,beautiful and timeless -Rosalie Sorrels meets the Only Ones!” - Devendra Banhart\n\"Sweet music, just like Sylvie\" - Brian Wilson (The Beach Boys).\n\"A wonderful record, sparse and figure-hugging, the emotion so directly delivered that one senses that Ms Simmons is hiding in the corridor.\" - Record Collector\n\nBEYOND THE MUSIC: Please The Trees’ planting trees project\nFacebook profile: https://www.facebook.com/pleasethetreesproject\nMap of planted trees:
