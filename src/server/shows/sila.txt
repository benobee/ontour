With lyrics in both English and Swahili, the SILA's sound is a funky fusion of African rhythm, funk, afrobeat, and reggae, influenced by artists like James Brown, Prince, Otis Redding, and Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti. In 2010, SILA won the coveted NAACP Image award for \"Outstanding World Music Album\" and the San Francisco Weekly music award for \"Best International Act.\"\r\n\r\nChristened the James Brown of Africa, SILA sings of the African experience: the problems he and many others face every day, in a language understood throughout the world. His lyrics and beats reflect the music, the language, the energy, and the spirit of growing up in Africa., Like Afro-beat founder Fela Kuti, the band is known for extended rifts that drive audiences into dancing ecstasy.\r\n\r\nSILA highly anticipated solo album and comic book \"SuperAfrican\" is due out February 2014 and features guest appearances by band members from Carlos Santana, Michael Franti & Spearhead, Sting and Bay Area local superstars.\r\n\r\nSAMBADA\r\nThere's a beach where one sunny afternoon you may witness an offering to an Afro-Brazilian Orixa spirit of the ocean, the next day watch master capoeristas practicing Brazil's martial art dance form, and still another day join a gathering of thousands of surfers-cum-dancers rocking out to hybrid musical sounds informed by bloco afro (Afro-Brazilian percussion music), samba-reggae, surf-rock, and California funk. No, these are not the shores of Bahia, Brazil. This is Santa Cruz, California, home of the surf-and-skate, capoeira-kicking, scene-busting phenomenon known as SambaDa. This smoldering and soldering band is a magnet of unexpected particles shaved from Brazilian and American sources. This community of people—their local fanbase and their Brazilian ancestors, their people—are honored in the title of SambaDa's new album Gente!","artists":[{"id":6450571,"name":"Sila Mutungi","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6370811.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6370811.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SilaMutungi/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/silamusic","tracker_count":10213,"url":"SilaMutungi","website":""},{"id":24378,"name":"Sambada","mbid":"84075e2b-5f8f-4c11-bb95-7139eda3d5b5","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Sambada/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/sambadaband","tracker_count":1618,"url":"Sambada","website":"http://www.sambada.com"}],"venue":{"name":"SILA + SAMBADA (Dancing Shoes Required)","place":"The Chapel","city":"San Francisco","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":37.760572,"longitude":-122.421436},"ontour_id":"TiJKwdBW5oeFoqKB4","genres":["turkish pop"]},{"id":7315477,"artist_id":6450571,"artist_event_id":7971627,"title":"Sila Mutungi @ The Chapel in San Francisco, CA","datetime":"2014-01-17T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, January 17, 2014 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"San Francisco, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/7315477?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Sila+Mutungi&came_from=67","description":"Hailed as “Africa’s James Brown,” Sila has made an immediate and lasting impact on the music world. As a 2010 NAACP Award winner for his last record, Sila has delved deep into his soul, taking cues from his musical idols Fela and Bob Marley to create a fiery new record that resounds with inspiration and positivity while speaking to issues of adversity and struggle. Set to hit February 25, SuperAfrican boasts rhythms and a groove that are so uniquely Sila that it will no doubt have you dancing through each and every listen.\r\n\r\nSila will also be releasing a comic book titled SuperAfrican, which visually explores many of the same themes and ideas that are woven throughout his album. The comic book, written by Eric K. Arnold, focuses on a young African superhero who takes on villains in African settings, from refugee camps to diamond mines. Sila's’s goal is to offer youth in Africa a superhero who not only looks like them, but also fights the evils they know all too well. All net proceeds from the sale of the comic book will go to onemama.org, a non-profit organization that provides a self-sustaining medical clinic that promotes safe birthing environments; family and financial planning; and trade, craft and agricultural education in Kirindi, Uganda. OneMama’s goal is to raise funds to build a library for its community center, where youth and adults can obtain books and other reading materials not only for entertainment but also for education and health-related information.\r\n\r\nThe Kenyan-born artist, who has lived in San Francisco for the last decade, harked back to his childhood in a rural village near Nairobi for inspiration while making the new album. The result is a twelve-track offering that shimmers, pulses and throbs with earnest and heartfelt expressions of American pop, R&B, soul and funk, filtered through an Afropop prism. SuperAfrican features all live instrumentation and showcases the contributions of world-class Bay Area musicians, including members of Santana, Michael Franti & Spearhead, Sting, and Jazz Mafia, among others.\r\n\r\nWith SuperAfrican, Sila has made an album suitable for making love, wrestling lions, or enjoying a night out.

ile 10 Yıl..  Sıla ON’dan Kalan Şarkılar ile  Maslak TİM Show Center'da  sevenlerine yine unutulmaz bir gece yaşatacak.   Sıla, kendi şarkılarının yanı sıra geçmişten bugüne heybesinde biriktirdiği efsane şarkılarla sevenlerine yine unutulmaz bir gece yaşatacak.  “Her şeyden biraz kalır\" diyor birileri, çoğulluk haklılıktır. Kavanozda biraz kahve,kutuda biraz ekmek, insanda biraz acı.“ der şair. Her şeyden biraz kaldı bende de. En çok da on’dan kalana olacak cümlelerim. Bir kere ne olduysa oldu çok şarkı oldu. Hep şarkı oldu, hep şiir oldu. Çocuklar okullarından mezun oldu, evler değiştirdik, sevgililer, eşler, işler değiştirdik. Aşık olduk. Gidenler oldu, araflar oldu, kalan sağlar bizim oldu, sınavlar verdik, özlemler arttı, jüpiter bu ay tekrar akrep burcuna geldi, televizyona daha az bakar olduk, fotoğraflara daha çok. Zamanın nasıl geçtiğine inanamadık. Daha dün gibi dediğimiz her şey on’dan kalan oldu. Kalbim elimde yaşadım her zaman, hem size hem kendime ses oldum, saz oldum, söz oldum. Siz de aldınız beni size kattınız. Hoş geldik, hoş gördük. Beraber oturduk sofralara, dans ettik, gözyaşı olduk, omuz ya da bi kahkaha... Evine bıraktık o kızı, kapının önüne koyduk oğlanı. Aşk ettik, meşk ettik, rest çektik. Belki istifa ettik, yalnızlığımızı bölüştük, mutluluklarımızı çoğalttık, iki ayağımızın üstünde durduk en çok da. Tahmin edebildiğimizden daha çok anımızda olduk belki. Ben hep duydum sizi. Siz de beni...

Winner of NAACP Image Awards and SF Weekly Music Awards, SILA a native of Kenya, sings of the African experience: the problems he and many others face every day, in a language understood throughout the world. Sila has delves deep into his soul, taking cues from his musical inspirations Fela and Bob Marley to create a a live show that resounds with inspiration and positivity while speaking to issues of adversity and struggle. His lyrics and beats are the latest step in a journey that has taken him from Africa to the United States to Europe, and back again, while allowing him to share his own story with the world through music.  \"Kenyan funk master\" - San Francisco Chronicle  \"Africa's James Brown.\" - Oakland Post LAGOS ROOTS  http://lagosroots.net  https://www.facebook.com/lagosroots/  Fronted by Geoffrey Omadhebo (Sonny Okosuns, One World), this 15-piece afrobeat orchestra brings it back, straight to 1970’s West Africa. LAGOS ROOTS presents a version of unfiltered, deeply-grooved Nigerian/ WestCoast Afrobeat that follows a direct path to the beginnings of the genre. The band's performances feature a healthy blend of Fela Kuti & Africa 70 classic repertoire with Omadhebo's own politically charged compositions, and in classical afrobeat fashion, the music speaks for itself, offering audiences a sharp reminder of the ability of live music to capture a political and historical message and spin it back to the public in a contemporary and provocatively musical way.  Based in Oakland, California, LAGOS ROOTS has emerged from a long held dream to put together a band of original master musicians with members of a new generation of afrobeat musicians. In addition to Omadhebo (first a drummer, now a vocalist), who began his career in the early 1970's playing drums and recording hits with the bands One World, Sonny Okosuns, Wrinkars Experience and The Nigerian Allstars, LAGOS ROOTS often features other stars of Nigeria's top afro-beat, afro-funk/rock and world-beat bands who now reside in the Bay Area. This famous LAGOS ROOTS cast of musicians includes: Tutu Shorunmu (guitar, Africa 70), Christy Agbe (vocals, Africa 70), Candido Obajimi (percussion, Monomono), Sikiru Adepoju (Mickey Hart, Babatunde Olatunji), Friday Jumbo (congas, Africa 70, Monomono) and Babatunde Williams (trumpet, Africa 70, Manu Dibango). Rounding out the band's section members are a supremely solid group of younger Bay Area musicians, whose talents are often lent to a host of other Bay Area bands, including ChaChing!, Guy Fox, Bulk, Midnight Raid, Mad Noise, Damon & the Heathens, Caught in Motion, Afromassive, The Grease Traps, and the Funk Revival Orchestra.   Representing an important step in the evolution of the style of Nigerian afrobeat once imagined by Fela Kuti & Africa 70, the LAGOS ROOTS AFROBEAT ENSEMBLE brings an extraordinary vision to the stage, complete with horns blasting melodies and backgrounds, driving bass lines and characteristic guitar interplay, authentic vintage keyboards, and a full drum and percussion section that is always grooving. Prepare to dial in on the dance floor and sweat to the beat of the Kalakuta Republic, live with LAGOS ROOTS!","artists":[{"id":6450571,"name":"Sila Mutungi","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6370811.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6370811.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SilaMutungi/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/silamusic","tracker_count":10213,"url":"SilaMutungi","website":""},{"id":6450571,"name":"Sila Mutungi","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SilaMutungi/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/silamusic","tracker_count":10213,"url":"SilaMutungi","website":""},{"id":1032739,"name":"LAGOS ROOTS","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/LagosRoots/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lagos-Roots/271429252387","tracker_count":646,"url":"LagosRoots","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"SILA + LAGOS ROOTS ","place":"The Chapel ","city":"San Francisco","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":37.7605475,"longitude":-122.4213865},"ontour_id":"TiJKwdBW5oeFoqKB4","genres":["turkish pop"]},{"id":16406580,"artist_id":6450571,"artist_event_id":21150631,"title":"Sila Mutungi @ Le Bataclan in Paris, France","datetime":"2018-03-02T20:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, March 2, 2018 at 8:30PM","formatted_location":"Paris, France","ticket_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16406580/buy_tickets?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Sila+Mutungi&came_from=67","ticket_type":"Tickets","ticket_status":"available","on_sale_datetime":"2018-01-10T16:45:40","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16406580?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Sila+Mutungi&came_from=67","description":"Sila","artists":[{"id":6450571,"name":"Sila Mutungi","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6370811.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6370811.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SilaMutungi/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/silamusic","tracker_count":10213,"url":"SilaMutungi","website":""}],"venue":{"name":"Le Bataclan","place":"Le Bataclan","city":"Paris","region":null,"country":"France","latitude":48.863063,"longitude":2.370815},"ontour_id":"TiJKwdBW5oeFoqKB4","genres":["turkish pop"]},{"id":16373603,"artist_id":6450571,"artist_event_id":21100334,"title":"Sila Mutungi @ indigo At The O2 in London, United Kingdom","datetime":"2018-05-17T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, May 17, 2018 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"London, United Kingdom","ticket_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16373603/buy_tickets?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Sila+Mutungi&came_from=67","ticket_type":"Tickets","ticket_status":"available","on_sale_datetime":"2018-01-12T11:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/16373603?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Sila+Mutungi&came_from=67","description":"Sila","artists":[{"id":6450571,"name":"Sila Mutungi","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6370811.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6370811.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SilaMutungi/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/silamusic","tracker_count":10213,"url":"SilaMutungi","website":""}],"venue":{"name":"indigo At The O2","place":"indigo At The O2","city":"London","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.5073346,"longitude":-0.1276831},"ontour_id":"TiJKwdBW5oeFoqKB4","genres":["turkish pop"]}]
