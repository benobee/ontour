Described as “Southern-Fried feminism with a side of crass and a tall glass of sass,” Katy Frame and Marie Cecile Anderson have toured the country as opening acts for \"Weird Al\" Yankovic and Alice Cooper, but with over a million views on YouTube and growing list of Network TV appearances, the Brooklyn based pair are set for a primetime spot on the national comedy scene.  Their sophomore record \"Don't Beat Around the Bush\" debuted in the top 20 iTunes comedy albums of 2016 and GRAND OLE CUNTRY, which premiered last month at the Edinburgh Fringe was hailed by the press as \"A magnificently bawdy celebration of female sexuality” and \"Genuinely endearing and unflinchingly upbeat.\" (Broadway Baby)  On Tuesday October 24th, REFORMED WHORES will bring their female centered brand of delightfully raunchy comedy to one of Manhattan’s most notable stages, the Cutting Room, an elegant tavern beloved by performers like Lady Gaga, Emmy Lou Harris, Cyndi Lauper, and the late Joan Rivers.  The evening will also feature MARCUS MONROE, aka the rock star of jugglers, as well as the incomparable BASTARD KEITH, as Master of Ceremonies.","artists":[{"id":1198532,"name":"Reformed Whores","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8444715.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8444715.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ReformedWhores/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Reformed%20Whores/126373324045732","tracker_count":2962,"url":"ReformedWhores","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Grand Ole Cuntry at The Cutting Room ","place":"The Cutting Room","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.745825,"longitude":-73.982822},"ontour_id":"WymozfJJ6ysWAYLFZ","genres":[]},{"id":15384345,"artist_id":1198532,"artist_event_id":20149336,"title":"Reformed Whores @ THE LAST PODCAST ON THE LEFT'S SAMHAIN GALA in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2017-10-28T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 28, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15384345?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Reformed+Whores&came_from=67","description":"Goldenvoice presents A Halloween Charity Event THE LAST PODCAST ON THE LEFT'S SAMHAIN GALA Hosted by: Marcus Parks (Cave Comedy Radio, The Onion) @marcusparks Ben Kissel (TruTV, VH1, Red Eye on FOX NEWS) @BenKissel Henry Zebrowski (Heroes Reborn, Wolf Of Wall Street, Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell) @HenryLovesYou","artists":[{"id":1198532,"name":"Reformed Whores","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8444715.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8444715.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ReformedWhores/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Reformed%20Whores/126373324045732","tracker_count":2962,"url":"ReformedWhores","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"THE LAST PODCAST ON THE LEFT'S SAMHAIN GALA","place":"El Rey Theatre","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.062302,"longitude":-118.348892},"ontour_id":"WymozfJJ6ysWAYLFZ","genres":[]},{"id":15739537,"artist_id":1198532,"artist_event_id":20149426,"title":"Reformed Whores @ If You Build It at UCB Sunset in Los Angeles, CA","datetime":"2017-10-30T20:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Monday, October 30, 2017 at 8:30PM","formatted_location":"Los Angeles, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15739537?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Reformed+Whores&came_from=67","description":"Kara Klenk hosts some of the best up and coming stand up comics in the country as well as established headliners!

Christa Weiss  Straight out of art school with the style to match, Christa is one of only comedians in Boston capable of drawing an anatomically correct dick on a bathroom wall. Also she’s really funny, which is probably more important. Christa recently opened for Maria Bamford at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston, MA. She performed in the 2014 Boston Comedy Festival Woman’s Show and was a Comic in Residence at the Comedy Studio in Cambridge, MA. She has performed in the She Dot Comedy Festival in Toronto, the Women in Comedy Festival in Boston, Chicago Women’s Funny Festival, the HIGHlarious Comedy Festival in Seattle, the Cleveland Comedy Festival and the North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival. She regularly performs at clubs all over Boston and New England including Laugh Boston, the Wilbur, Nick’s Comedy Stop, the Comedy Studio, Dick’s, Improv Boston and any place else with a stage. Christa also appears in commercials for the New England Sports Network, is a featured performer on Rooftop Comedy and is the editor of UnSceneComedy.com, a humor website and resource for comedians in Boston. She also produces a female focused (but not female only) stand-up show called Broad Appeal, which she thinks is pretty cool.
