his unique style of hip hop with its message of peace and reconciliation born out of his experiences as a child soldier in Sudan. His music can be heard alongside Coldplay, Gorillaz, and Radiohead on the fundraising ‘Warchild – Help a Day in the Life’ album, as well as in three ER episodes, the National Geographic documentary God Grew Tired of Us, and more recently in the feature film Blood Diamond starring Leonardo DiCaprio. He was also featured on John Lennon’s ‘Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur’ amongst the likes of U2, REM and Lenny Kravitz.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel Jal was born in war-torn Sudan, and while he doesn’t know exactly when, he believes it was in the early 1980s. He was taken from his family home in 1987 when he was six or seven years old, and sent to fight with the rebel army in Sudan’s bloody civil war. For nearly five years, he was a “child warrior,” put into battle carrying an AK-47 that was taller than he was.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was 13, he was a veteran of two civil wars and had seen hundreds of his fellow child soldiers reduced to taking unspeakable measures as they struggled to survive on the killing fields of Southern Sudan. After a series of harrowing events, he was rescued by a British aid worker (Emma McCune) who smuggled him into Nairobi to raise him as her own.\r\n\r\nTo help ease the pain of what he had experienced, Emmanuel started singing. In 2005, he released his first album, Gua (”peace” in his native Nuer tongue), with the title track broadcast across Africa over the BBC and becoming a number one hit in Kenya. Gua also earned him a spot on Bob Geldof’s “Live 8″ concert in the UK.\r\n\r\nJal performed at Nelson Mandela’s 90th birthday celebrations in Hyde Park, London, June 08, he shared a stage with Alicia Keys, Annie Lennox, Damien Marley and Stephen Marley at the Black Ball in London in July 08 and also addressed delegates at the UN in New York in the same month.

Emmanuel Jal will be speaking and performing, along with storytellers Mariatu Kamara and Preeti Chopra, who will share their incredible stories of strength, forgiveness and peace.\n\nProceeds will go to Gua Africa, founded by Emmanuel, to help support young people from South Sudan who are fleeing the country because of war. Gua Africa believes that giving everyone access to education will lead to an increase in individuals generating their own income and more stable society. Its projects combine scholarship and feeding programmes and teaching in refugee camps, all underpinned by a philosophy of peace and education and a dedication to community income generation.\n\nFor

Clarke Richardson Collegiate, Ajax, Ontario.\n“This event is valuable to the community of Durham as it reflects the importance of its own cultural diversity with the many nations represented here,” says Esther Forde, event Chair.“ Specifically, this event helps to recognize, preserve and promote the contributions of Black peoples across the African diaspora.\nThis free event is open to the public and boasts an exceptional line up of talent including Key Note Speaker, Emmanuel Jal, a South Sudanese-Canadian musician, actor, former child soldier, political activist and former refugee. Jal has also performed for Nelson Mandela, the Dali Lama, and at the World Cup. Electric performances by COBA (Collective of Black Artists) will also grace the stage with traditional West African dance, music and folklore as well as Caribbean indigenous folk dance and music in their purest forms. Finally, youth ensemble, NGOMA, will deliver a dynamic presentation of drum pieces that educate, honour and embrace the beauty of African history.\n“We are very excited to coordinate and offer this rich, educational program in honour of Black History Month, and to recognize our community’s contribution in Canada as it celebrates 150 years as a nation,” says Dane Lawrence, event Co Chair.\nCultural Expressions Black History Month Celebration is supported by the Town of Ajax, the Congress of Black Women, Durham District School Board, Canadian Jamaican Club (Oshawa), and the Durham Black Educators’ Network.\nStarting from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. the evening will also include a networking session, information booths, (with community, service, arts, health, and business organisations) and cultural food samplings.\n","artists":[{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8434579.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8434579.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null},{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Cultural Expressions Black History Month Celebration","place":"J.

As agents, managers, presenters, promoters, journalists, artists, and audiences, we all have a part to play in amplifying this exchange. We need to make it our mission to use whatever power we have at our disposal—the power of media, the power of capital, and the power of music—to promote communication, collaboration, and understanding. At this critical cultural moment, the ContraBanned: #MusicUnites showcase gives a platform to artists from the diasporas of the often misunderstood and misrepresented Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOn Friday, January 27th, 2017, the White House issued an Executive Order banning entry to the U.S. for ninety days to the citizens of seven majority Muslim countries—Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—and banning entry to Syrian refugees indefinitely. Though the initial Executive Order has been temporarily suspended, it continues to have massive social and political impact.\n\nFor those who work to promote cultural diversity and inclusion in America, its impact has been disastrous. Artists are wary of coming to the US, hearing horror stories of airport detentions and cancelled visas. Arts presenters, labels, and agents are reluctant to risk working with foreign artists for fears of shifting immigration policies, which could scuttle a long-planned project.\n\nThis ban comes at a time when access to positive presentation of cultural diversity is more important than ever. ContraBanned: #MusicUnites affirms that music is universal, and can be a tool for positive change.

Advocate. Author. Actor\nREPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN\n\nFrom his start in life as a child soldier in the war-torn region of Southern Sudan in the early 1980s, Emmanuel Jal has come through a huge number of struggles during his life to become a successful and acclaimed recording artist and peace ambassador.\nIn 2008 a full-length documentary on his life was released. The film, Warchild, won 12 prestigious film festival awards worldwide. In the same year, his autobiography, also calledWarchild, was published by Little Brown.\n\nEmmanuel has released five award nominated studio albums and he has collaborated and performed alongside artists such as Lauryn Hill, Peter Gabriel, Nelly Furtado, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, Nile Rodgers and Alicia Keys.\n\nEmmanuel co-starred with Reese Witherspoon in the Warner Brothers motion picture, The Good Lie which tells the story about the journey of four young Sudanese refugees (based on The Lost Boys of Sudan) who win a lottery for relocation to the United States.\n\nIn 2010, Jal launched ‘We Want Peace’, a campaign that calls for peace, protection and justice for all in Sudan, as well as calling for an end to all conflicts from around the world. This campaign is supported by a number of A-list stars and leaders, including George Clooney, Alicia Keys, Richard Branson, Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter and Kofi Annan.","artists":[{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8434579.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8434579.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null},{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Betel Nut","place":"Betel Nut","city":"Sukawati","region":"02","country":"Indonesia","latitude":-8.50495,"longitude":115.254799},"ontour_id":"yryJEaaiDcsTepCPG","genres":[]},{"id":14074324,"artist_id":104460,"artist_event_id":17837487,"title":"Emmanuel Jal @ The Green School in Bali, Indonesia","datetime":"2017-03-22T13:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, March 22, 2017 at 1:00PM","formatted_location":"Bali, Indonesia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14074324?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Emmanuel+Jal&came_from=67","description":"Emmanuel Jal visits students of Bali's The Green School to share his personal story and approach to social emotional learning.","artists":[{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8434579.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8434579.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null},{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"The Green School","place":"The Green School","city":"Bali","region":"06","country":"Indonesia","latitude":-6.1230556,"longitude":106.9908333},"ontour_id":"yryJEaaiDcsTepCPG","genres":[]},{"id":13803792,"artist_id":104460,"artist_event_id":17003558,"title":"Emmanuel Jal @ BaliSpirit Festival in Bali, Indonesia","datetime":"2017-03-24T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, March 24, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Bali, Indonesia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13803792?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Emmanuel+Jal&came_from=67","description":"Each year the BaliSpirit Festival attracts a diverse blend of headlining and emerging artists from across the globe, performing high-vibration world music on a picturesque outdoor temple stage.

believe I survived for a reason… to tell my story… to touch lives.\n- Emmanuel Jal\n\nEmmanuel Jal knows that empathy plays an essential role in social change, particularly for young people. Born into the life of a child soldier in Sudan on an unknown date in the early 1980s, today Emmanuel shares his message of peace and reconciliation worldwide through his music and talks. He has spoken to hundreds of thousands of young people from all over the world, touring across Mexico, the UK, the US, Kenya, Zambia and Canada. On these tours, he visits community centres, youth detention centres and prisons to speak first hand to young people who have become disengaged with education and society. He believes that through music and storytelling, emotional empathy can allow young people to connect with larger social and political issues.\n\nAn internationally acclaimed hip hop artist, peace ambassador and entrepreneur, Emmanuel is widely recognised for his commitment to peace building. He has addressed the UN, US Congress and the highest level of several governments. He is a key spokesperson for Amnesty International, a Young Global Leader for the World Economic Forum and has performed for Nelson Mandela and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In addition to his music and speaking, Emmanuel co-founded “The Key is E”, a social business and charity channeling the power of education, entrepreneurialism and creativity to impact social change. He also founded Gua Africa, an organisation devoted to promoting education in Africa and providing education to children and young adults who would otherwise be denied this opportunity.\n\nThis event is a unique opportunity to hear Emmanuel Jal in conversation with Dumbo Feather. Emmanuel will share his personal story through words and performance, and we will ask him how music, storytelling, empathy and education contributes to peace on a local and global level.\n\nProudly presented in collaboration with Dumbo Feather and Igniting Change.","artists":[{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8434579.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8434579.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null},{"id":104460,"name":"Emmanuel Jal","mbid":"0ca5108c-fd3b-4de7-93a0-da7666a39c3e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EmmanuelJal/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EmmanuelJal","tracker_count":6059,"url":"EmmanuelJal","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Emmanuel Jal on Empathy & Education","place":"Clemenger Auditorium National Gallery of Victoria","city":"St Kilda","region":"Vic","country":"Australia","latitude":-37.86146,"longitude":144.98505},"ontour_id":"yryJEaaiDcsTepCPG","genres":[]},{"id":14291855,"artist_id":104460,"artist_event_id":18149659,"title":"Emmanuel Jal @ Australia Tour Farewell Night in Melbourne, Australia","datetime":"2017-04-08T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Melbourne, Australia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14291855?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Emmanuel+Jal&came_from=67","description":"Emmanuel Jal last concert & farewell party on Saturday 08/04/2017.
