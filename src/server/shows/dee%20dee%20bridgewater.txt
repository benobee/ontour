King, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Lalo Schifrin and more...\r\n\r\nFor six decades, Kenny Burrell’s name has been synonymous with jazz guitar. And as the founder and director of UCLA’s Jazz Studies program, his name on campus is legendary. This special event celebrates the incredible life and career of this influential performer, composer, bandleader and producer in a one-night-only, all-star event featuring tribute performances from blues legend B.B. King (who cites Burrell as his “favorite guitarist”), multi-Grammy-winning vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater, pianist Lalo Schifrin and others. \r\n\r\nThe night will feature on-stage collaborations between these artists as well as the world premieres of two new works. Backed by the UCLA Philharmonia, Burrell will perform a new composition by recent UCLA music department chair Dr. Roger Bourland. Also, Fantasy for Orchestra, a new piece written by world-renowned composer and UCLA faculty member Dr. Paul Chihara and based on Burrell’s own Prayer for Peace will be premiered.  The night will also include the debut of a unique collaborative orchestral composition dedicated to World Peace with music by Patrick Williams, John Clayton, Bill Banfield, James Newton, Kenny Burrell and others.  Additional performers include the award-winning UCLA Jazz Orchestra, directed by Charley Harrison, the Los Angeles Jazz Orchestra Unlimited—L.A.’s new repertoire orchestra featuring many of the best musicians in Southern California—and one of Burrell’s favorite working groups, the Jazz Heritage All Stars, a legendary four-horn and four-rhythm Jazz tribute ensemble.\r\n\r\n**This show is not

Dee Bridgewater To Billie With Love: A Celebration Of Lady Day\r\n\r\nOver the course of a multifaceted career that has spanned four decades, DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER has risen to the top tier of today’s jazz vocalists, putting her own unique spin on standards as well as taking intrepid leaps of faith in re-envisioning jazz classics. For her latest recording, ELEANORA FAGAN (1915-1959): TO BILLIE WITH LOVE FROM DEE DEE, Bridgewater honors an iconic jazz figure, Billie Holiday, who died tragically at the age of 44 a half-century ago.\r\n\r\n“This album is my way of paying my respect to a vocalist who made it possible for singers like me to carve out a career for ourselves,” says Bridgewater, who performed the role of Holiday in the triumphant theatrical production, Lady Day—based on the singer’s autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues—staged in Paris and London in 1986 and 1987. “I wanted Eleanora Fagan to be something different: more modern and a celebration, not a [recording] that goes dark and sullen and maudlin. I wanted the album to be joyful.”\r\n\r\nBridgewater adds that Eleanora Fagan goes far deeper than being a tribute album of retreaded Holiday tunes. “Billie deserves to have her music heard in another light,” she says, “and I definitely didn’t set out to imitate her.”\r\n\r\nDon't miss this incredible performance...\r\n\r\nOne show only!  8:00pm.  Tickets $40.00.  Available at the Ritz Box Office and Ticketmaster.com.

The bands take turns performing for some of the greatest names in professional jazz today, who offer critiques and award a variety of honors. The professionals cap off each night of the Festival with a rousing performance of their own.\r\n\r\n  For the college bands, the Festival offers a great opportunity to learn from some of today’s greatest jazz musicians. For the audience, it’s a chance to hear both college bands and jazz greats.\r\n\r\n  The current Elmhurst College Jazz Festival rose from the ashes of the American College Jazz Festival, which was established in 1968.\r\n\r\nThe original festival took place at eight regional sites throughout the United States, one of which was Elmhurst College. Each regional festival produced a winning band, combo, and vocalist, who then performed at a national festival on Memorial Day weekend.   \r\n\r\nThe national festival disbanded in 1973, but the Elmhurst Festival continued—and grew, both in size and in stature. By 1992, the Festival had hosted so many jazz greats that its Silver Anniversary reunion of guest artists and judges included Louie Bellson, Pete Christlieb, Conte Candoli, Terry Gibbs, Frank Mantooth, Bobby Shew, Clark Terry, Denis DiBlasio, Lee Konitz, and Jiggs Whigham. The celebration made such a splash that it was featured on CBS-TV’s Sunday Morning News.  \r\n\r\nSince then, the Festival’s reputation has continued to grow. Festival performers in recent years have included the Maria Schneider Orchestra, the Mingus Big Band, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, the Bob Mintzer Big Band, the Dave Holland Quintet, Joe Lovano, the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, Nicholas Payton, the Bill Holman Band, Diana Krall, Phil Woods, Maynard Ferguson, Dee Dee Bridgewater, John Fedchock, Byron Stripling, Mike Abene, Randy Brecker, Lanny Morgan, and the Count Basie Orchestra.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee

Hun debuterede i New York i begyndelsen af 70'erne i Thad Jones og Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra, som hun også turnerede verden rundt med . I midten af 70'erne havde hun flere roller musicals på Broadway, og rollen som Glinda i musicalen The Wiz gav hende en Tony Award.\r\n\r\nHun var også med i Los Angeles-opsætningen af \"Sophisticated Ladies\". I 1986 flyttede Dee Dee til Paris og forlod musicalverdenen for at synge jazz på fuld tid. Hendes album \"Dear Ella\" fra 1988 fik en Grammy for \"best vocal jazz album\". Hun har også samarbejdet med afrikanske musikere, som på albummet \"Red Earth\".\r\n\r\nI København skal vi høre hende opføre musik af Billie Holiday sammen med Norrbotten Big Band, som hun i 2011 var på en succesfuld turné med. Norrbotten Big Band betragtes i dag som et af de førende af såvel svenske som internationale anmeldere. Orkestret består af yderst erfarne ensemblemusikere med høj solistisk substans. Mange års turnéer, cd'er og koncerter på store jazzfestivaler har resulteret i, at interessen for Norrbotten Big Band er øget.\r\n\r\nDen tidligere leder af big bandet, trompetisten Tim Hagans, arbejdede målrettet og lykkedes med at give bandet et internationalt niveau. Norrbotten Big Band har gennem årene arbejdet med store jazznavne som Toots Thielemans, Maria Schneider, Joe Lovano, David Liebman, Chris Potter, Bobby Shew, Randy Brecker, Rufus Reid, Peter Erskine med flere.\r\n\r\nI maj 2009 indspillede de \"The Avatar Sessions\" i New York City med musik Tim Hagans og med gæstesolister som Randy Brecker, Peter Erskine, George Garzone, Dave Liebman, Rufus Reid. Cd'en blev nomineret til en Grammy.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":2526401,"name":"Norbotten Big Band","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/NorbottenBigBand/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"NorbottenBigBand","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Koncerthuset -

The stateside home of the festival is downtown Miami where a three day jazz celebration will take place beginning on October 26, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe first Miami Nice Jazz Festival is a partnership between Sister Cities Nice, France and Miami, Florida, joining forces under the leadership of the festival’s founder and CEO, Philippe Pautesta-Herder. The festival takes place in downtown Miami’s historic gem, the Olympia Theater at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts. “Downtown Miami provides the perfect backdrop for the festival as Miami is a city rich in historic heritage and culture parallel to that embodied by the festival, its musicians and its patrons”, said the festival founder.\r\n\r\nThe festival kicks off Miami French Week, a month designed to promote French culture in South Florida. “The Miami Nice Jazz Festival is the first and only jazz festival of such international significance to come to South Florida and I am extremely grateful to be a part of such an iconic occurrence”, said Philippe.\r\n\r\nThe lineup will showcase an eclectic mix of both straight-ahead and Latin jazz performances, highlighting legendary artists such as Dee Dee Bridgewater (Festival Ambassador), Eddie Palmieri Latin Jazz Band along with Florida debuts of bassist Kyle Eastwood, and French drummer André Ceccarelli featuring Alex Ligertwood (former lead singer of Santana).\r\n\r\nAlso scheduled to perform at the festival will be the Florida International University Big Band featuring vocalist Sally Night and The South Florida Jazz Orchestra with Chuck Bergeron featuring Nicole Henry. Jazz student bands from Florida International University and University of Miami will also animate the Gusman Center each night when doors open at 7:00 p.m.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":746844,"name":"Edsel Gomez","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EdselGomez/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":42,"url":"EdselGomez","website":null},{"id":174436,"name":"Craig Handy","mbid":"4f48f10b-3add-429a-9dfa-c24bf708ad8b","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CraigHandy/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":467,"url":"CraigHandy","website":null},{"id":1022982,"name":"Kenny Davis","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KennyDavis/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":199,"url":"KennyDavis","website":null},{"id":2068905,"name":"Kenny Phelps","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/KennyPhelps/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":1,"url":"KennyPhelps","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Miami-Nice Jazz Festival","place":"Olympia Theater at Gusman Center for the Performing Arts","city":"Miami","region":"FL","country":"United States","latitude":25.773895,"longitude":-80.190538},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":5425995,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":5454745,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Lang Lang and Friends at Carnegie Hall in New York, NY","datetime":"2012-10-30T18:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, October 30, 2012 at 6:30PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/5425995?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"The Foundation's founder and internationally acclaimed pianist, Lang Lang, will give a special one-night only concert at Carnegie Hall's Stern Auditorium on Tuesday, October 30 at 6:30PM  to raise funds for the Foundation.

Dee Bridgewater performs live at famous Ronnie Scott's.\r\n\r\nEver since his trips in the late 40s and early 50s to the jazz clubs of New York's 52nd Street, Ronnie Scott had dreamed of opening his own London club. In 1959, the dream came true. Together with Pete King (a fellow tenor saxophonist and personal friend) Ronnie Scott's club opened in Gerrard Street, in London's Soho.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the plan was simply to provide a place where British jazz musicians could jam. Pete and Ronnie quickly developed a reputation of bringing the best of British modern jazz musicians to the club. Soon, they would persuade the American federation of musicians to lift the blanket ban on American performers in the U.K., paving the way for many legendary performances. In 1965, Ronnie Scotts moved to its current location in Frith Street, only a short walk from the 'old place'.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee

Eine Diva. Eine Frau in direkter Nachkommenschaft von Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald oder Sarah Vaughan. In ihrer Musik erzählt sie von Liebe und Schmerz, vom Leben und vom Tod. Wenn sie singt, dann kommt ihre Kunst direkt im Gefühlszentrum ihrer Zuhörer an. Und gleichzeitig weiß sie, wie rational die Welt funktioniert. Ihr Engagement galt mehr als einmal den Schwachen und Unterdrückten. Derlei Größe und Kraft wird honoriert: Bereits mehrfach wurde sie für einen Grammy nominiert, zwei Mal durfte sie die Trophäe mit nach Hause nehmen. Die Rede ist von Dee Dee Bridgewater.\r\n\r\nDas Beste war schon immer gut genug für diese wunderbare Sängerin mit der betörenden Alt-Stimme. Bekannt wurde sie als Vokalistin der legendären Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Band, bis zum heutigen Tag für viele eine der wichtigsten Big Bands im Jazz überhaupt. Doch Dee Dee Bridgewater hatte das Zeug zu mehr. Bis zum heutigen Tag ist sie eine begnadete Performerin, die es geradezu magisch auf die Bühne zog. So war es kein Wunder, dass der Broadway auf sie aufmerksam wurde. Mitte der siebziger Jahre spielte sie die Rolle der Glinda im Musical „The Wiz“, bekam dafür prompt einen „Tony Award“, im Jahr darauf wurde der gesamte Soundtrack mit dem Grammy ausgezeichnet.\r\n\r\nDabei war sich Dee Dee Bridgewater stets ihrer Verantwortung bewusst, die Leistungen ihrer großen Vorbilder fortzuschreiben. Eine ganze Reihe von Tribute-Alben durchziehen ihr außergewöhnliches Gesamtwerk, wobei sie immer auch gerade das Soziale in den Vordergrund ihrer Betrachtungen stellte. Da macht sie auch im wirklichen Leben nicht Halt: Seit Jahren ist sie als UN-Botschafterin gegen den Welthunger aktiv.\r\n\r\n+49 6142/832784","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee

Jazzsongs von der First Lady of Jazz\r\nEinen bleibenden Eindruck bei den palatia jazz Festivalgästen hinterließ DeeDee Bridgewater als sie 2008 ihr Album „Red Earth“ in der Klosterruine Limburg vorstellte und ein fantastisches Konzert zelebrierte. Mit dem Eröffnungskonzert der 18. Festivalsaison bietet sie als berufene „First Lady of Jazz“ eine Auswahl Liebesballaden aus ihrem aktuellen Album Midnight Sun sowie einige von ihr ausgesuchte amerikanische Jazzstandards großer Jazzdiven vergangener Jahrzehnte, wie beispielsweise Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday und Sarah Vaughan. \r\n\r\nDass Dee Dee Bridgewater ein Energiebündel sondergleichen ist, weiß jeder, der sie einmal live erlebt hat. Ihre erfolgreiche Karriere als Jazzsängerin ist gekrönt von Grammy- Auszeichnungen, dem ECHO-Jazz, wie dem Tony Award. Sie erhielt 2012 für Ihr künstlerisches Gesamtwerk den Edison Jazz Award nebst anderen Ehrungen – so wie sie sich seit 1999 als UN-Botschafterin gegen den Welthunger einsetzt. \r\n\r\nSie hat sich in ihrer Karriere auf ihren ebenso populären wie hoch gelobten Alben musikalisch schon mit vielen Themen auseinandergesetzt: Ella Fitzgerald (\"Dear Ella\"), aber auch Billie Holiday, Horace Silver, Kurt Weill und viele mehr. Den französischen Song- Klassikern setzte sie ihren ganz eigenen musikalischen Stempel auf – so wie sie mit ihrer Stimme und ihrem Timbre eine unverwechselbare Präsenz erreicht. \r\n\r\nEine menschlich wie künstlerisch hochangesehene Persönlichkeit, auf deren Auftritt im Rahmen des palatia Jazz Festivals mit großer Freude entgegen gesehen wird. Und so bietet sich in Speyer eine einzigartige Gelegenheit Dee Dee Bridgewater zu hören. Ihr Konzert wird begleitet von dem Südwestdeutschen Kammerorchester Pforzheim unter der Leitung von Sebastian Tewinkel und dem Komponisten, Pianisten und Trompeter Sebastian Studnitzky.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee

Memphisen jaio zen Denese Garrett, 1950ean (1970ean hartu zuen egungo izen artistikoa, Cecil Bridgewater tronpeta-jotzailearekin ezkondu zenean), eta 1971n, Thad Jones & Mel Lewis Big Band-en sartu zen. Orkestra distiratsua eta berritzailea izan zen Jones eta Lewisena eta emanaldi asko eskaini zituen Dee Deek talde harekin, 1974ra arte. Heziketa bikaina izan zen aldi hura abeslariarentzat eta, bere karreran jauzi bat eginik, jazzeko izen sagaratuen orkestrekin elkarlanak egiten hasi zen: Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon…\r\n\r\n1974 eta 1976 artean, Broadwayko The Wiz ikuskizun musikalean lan egin zuen, eta Tony sari entzutetsua irabazi zuen han egindako lanagatik. Dee Deeren hurrengo aktore lana Billie Holiday berberaren interpretazioa izan zen Lady Day ikuskizunean, zeina Hamburgon, Londresen (Laurence Olivier sari prestigiotsurako izendatu zuten) eta Parisen antzeztu baitzen. Duke Ellingtonen musikak oinarritutako Sophisticated Lady ikuskizun musikalean ere lan egin zuen. Abeslari gisa, Dee Dee Bridgewater-ek hiru Grammy irabazi ditu, azkenekoa 2010ean, Eleanora Fagan (1915-1959): To Billie with Love from Dee Dee Bridgewater diskoagatik. Bakanak dira artearen eta eszenaren sail desberdinetan horrelako arrakasta izan duten artistak. Gainera, FAOko borondate oneko enbaxadorea da, munduko gosearen kontra lan egiten duen Nazio Batuen erakundekoa, alegia.\r\n\r\nKalitate handiko disko asko grabatu ditu, bluesa, scat-a eta estandarrak barne direla. 2011n haren lanen bilduma bat argitaratu zen Midnight Sun izenburupean.\r\n\r\nDee Dee Bridgewater –Parisen bizi izan zen bi hamarralditan– China Moses jazzeko izar berriaren ama da, zeina 2013ko Heineken Jazzaldian izan baikenuen.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee

Les deux complices sortiront le 20 avril prochain Dee Dee’s Feathers, un album gorgé de swing aux couleurs musicales de la Nouvelle Orléans, soutenu par l’exceptionnelle qualité du NOJO.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":11989984,"name":"Irvin Mayfield, Jr.","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/IrvinMayfield%2CJr./facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"IrvinMayfield,Jr.","website":null},{"id":12289754,"name":"The New Orleans Jazz Festival","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheNewOrleansJazzFestival/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"TheNewOrleansJazzFestival","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Wolfi Jazz Festival","place":"Fort Kléber","city":"Wolfisheim","region":null,"country":"France","latitude":48.5890608,"longitude":7.6644887},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":9583509,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":11529343,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Jazz à Vienne in Vienne, France","datetime":"2015-06-27T20:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, June 27, 2015 at 8:30PM","formatted_location":"Vienne, France","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/9583509?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER & The New Orleans Jazz Orchestra\n\nNative de Memphis, Dee Dee Bridgewater baigne dès son plus jeune âge dans la soul et le jazz grâce à son père trompettiste. À New York dans le début des 70’s, elle rejoint le big band de Thad Jones et Mel Lewis. Sa carrière démarre alors avec des collaborations prestigieuses : Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Dizzy Gillespie ou Max Roach. Le premier album de la chanteuse, orienté soul, paraît en 1974. Puis miss Bridgewater s'installe à Paris. Elle y incarne en 1986 Billie Holiday dans la comédie musicale Lady Day. Plus près de nous, en 2010, Dee Dee Bridgewater s’éloignait des terres rouges qui longent le fleuve Niger (Red Earth - A Malian Journey, son projet mandingue de 2007) avec le répertoire de To Billie With Love qui lui permet d’exprimer à nouveau sa fascination pour Lady Day. Notre diva DD retrouvait Vienne en 2013 en compagnie du pianiste Ramsey Lewis (“The Soul of Jazz”). \nLa voici de retour auréolée du soleil louisianais et entourée, comme lors de ses débuts new-yorkais, d’un big band de cadors : le New Orleans Jazz Orchestra (NOJO). Sa voix puissante investit là le funk sudiste, les brûlots façon Cosimo Matassa et les ballades éternelles de Crescent city. Entourée de ce allstar du jazz créole contemporain, Dee Dee propose un véritable spectacle multimédia, un show empli d’images, de textes et de chansons qui nous emportent au cœur de la Louisiane. Emmené par le célèbre trompettiste Irving Mayfield, le NOJO entretient depuis 2002 la flamme du jazz historique, de la Nouvelle-Orléans à New York ou San Fransisco. L’orchestre fêtait sa première décennie d’activisme louisianais (concerts, festivals, enseignement, archivage, marchandising) en invitant en 2012 au Carnegie Hall de New York Aaron Neville, Brandford Marsalis et Dee Dee Bridgewater. L’année suivante, tout l’orchestre embarquait dans le fameux train Spirit of New Orleans jusqu’aux grands lacs du Nord pour enflammer le Chicago Theater en compagnie de ses invités Allen Toussaint, Kurt Elling et le vénérable Preservation Hall Jazz Band. \nWelcome N.O, bienvenue DD.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":11989984,"name":"Irvin Mayfield, Jr.","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/IrvinMayfield%2CJr./facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"IrvinMayfield,Jr.","website":null},{"id":151233,"name":"New Orleans Jazz Orchestra","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/NewOrleansJazzOrchestra/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/nolaNOJO","tracker_count":179,"url":"NewOrleansJazzOrchestra","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Jazz à Vienne","place":"Théâtre Antique","city":"Vienne","region":null,"country":"France","latitude":45.5246433,"longitude":4.8780367},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":10020356,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":12144216,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Festival Stand'Éte in Moutier, Switzerland","datetime":"2015-06-28T21:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:00PM","formatted_location":"Moutier, Switzerland","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/10020356?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"Dee Dee's Feathers, dans les bacs depuis avril, donne une vision moderne de la Nouvelle Orléans dépeinte au travers de la collaboration du New Orleans Jazz Orchestra (NOJO), du directeur artistique Irvin Mayfield et de Dee Dee Bridgewater .\nDes chansons traditionnelles telles que Big Chief, Saint James Infirmary, et What a Wonderful World ainsi que de nouvelles compositions (Congo Square and C'est lei Que Je T'aime, ...) transportent le public dans le quartier historique de Treme.\nLe NOJO (18 musiciens!) se consacre essentiellement au développement et à l'héritage du jazz de la Nouvelle-Orléans.

So it was a natural decision to choose her as the successor of Branford Marsalis for the possibly most important jazz radio show in the world (NPR's JazzSET).","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":11989984,"name":"Irvin Mayfield, Jr.","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/IrvinMayfield%2CJr./facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"IrvinMayfield,Jr.","website":null},{"id":12289981,"name":"The New Orleans 7","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheNewOrleans7/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"TheNewOrleans7","website":null},{"id":12289900,"name":"Jasen Weaver","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JasenWeaver/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":1,"url":"JasenWeaver","website":null},{"id":770179,"name":"Adonis Rose","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AdonisRose/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":339,"url":"AdonisRose","website":null},{"id":208942,"name":"Victor Atkins","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/VictorAtkins/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":3,"url":"VictorAtkins","website":null},{"id":206658,"name":"Michael Watson","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MichaelWatson/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":85,"url":"MichaelWatson","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Festival da Jazz","place":"Festival da Jazz","city":"Sankt Moritz-Dorf","region":"Switzerland","country":"Switzerland","latitude":46.496101,"longitude":9.83866},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":10021252,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":12145714,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam, Netherlands","datetime":"2015-07-11T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Rotterdam, Netherlands","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/10021252?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"Singer Dee Dee Bridgewater more than deserves her reputation as a vocalist. For example, she has won no fewer than three Grammy Awards in a career spanning over four decades. Bridgewater recently embarked on a very special project together with multitalented Irvin Mayfield Jr. and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. She recorded traditional songs with their roots in the heart of New Orleans, Louisiana’s famed city of music. Her new album Dee Dee’s Feathers includes classics like Saint James Infirmary, What A Wonderful World and Big Chief. By joining forces with trumpeter and bandleader Mayfield Jr., the American singer is collaborating with someone who is perfectly equipped to revamp the musical tradition of New Orleans. He had already done so with his band Los Hombres Calientes and later with his powerful work Strange Fruit.

Her magnificent voice and interpretation capability has thrilled a large audience all over the world. The album 'Dear Ella' was a double Grammy Award winner, and she has also received several awards for her efforts in theater productions. After several earlier visits to Norway, Dee Dee has got many fans here at home, but now she comes with a program that surpasses most. In July she sings at Moldejazz, backed by a solid big band based around leading New Orleans musicians.\n\nThe repertoire is varied and exciting - from riveting New Orleans funk to ballads and swinging and rugged stomp-the-beat music. We are presented with a multimedia show featuring singing, music, pictures and text that will take the audience to the colorful and seething neighborhoods of New Orleans, Lousiana.\n\nThe big band - New Orleans Jazz Orchestra - led by the brilliant trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, represents traditional American big band culture with elements of second line funk at its best. The band made history when it, in November 2005, symbolically \"reopened\" New Orleans by performing Mayfields composition \"All the Saints\" in the Christ Church Cathedral. This concert was the first major cultural event in the city after Katrina hurricane.\n\n1. Conductor/Trumpet: Irvin Mayfield\n2. Clarinet: Evan Christopher\n3. Alto Saxophone: Aaron Fletcher\n4.

en La Costa Almuñécar\n\nDenise Garrett nació en Tennessee, pero se crió en Flint, Michigan, en cuya Universidad conoció a su marido, el trompetista Cecil Bridgewater. Después de una gira con la banda de jazz de la Universidad de Illinois por Rusia, pasó a formar parte de la orquesta de Thad Jones y Mel Lewis. Pero además de cantar, también le gustaba la interpretación y lo hacía tan bien que obtuvo el prestigioso Premio Tony por su papel en la producción teatral de Broadway: The Wiz.  Mientras, tenía tiempo para acompañar a maestros como Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon o  Dizzy Gillespie. \n\nA mediados de los ochenta se trasladó a París y, aunque no abandonó los escenarios, dedicó sus esfuerzos a actividades solidarias, siendo nombrada Embajadora de Buena Voluntad de la Organización para la Agricultura y la Alimentación (FAO) de la ONU.  Pero la música seguía siendo su vida y retoma su carrera de una manera tan excelente que todo lo que graba recibe numerosos premios. En 1991 publica Live in Paris, tres años más tarde, Keeping Tradition, y en 1995 graba para Verve, Love and Peace, disco homenaje a Horace Silver, al que la prensa aclama como una verdadera joya musical, y conlleva un reencuentro con su tierra natal  y de la exigente crítica y audiencia americana. Consolidada ya como una gran estrella del jazz, prosigue una extensa carrera discográfica con esplendidos discos como Dear Ella (1998), This is new (2002),en el que Dee Deeinterpreta brillantemente canciones de Kurt Weil, J’ai Deux Amour (2005) un personal y soberbio homenaje a clásicos franceses, o Red Earth (2007), un tributo a sus ancestros africanos.\n\nEn 2010 decide que la inspiración de tantas vocalistas de jazz se merecía un particular tributo y graba: Eleanora Fagan (1917-1959): To Billie with Love from Dee Dee Bridgewater,  obteniendo un Premio Grammy 2011 como Mejor Álbum de Jazz Vocal. \n\nDee Dee viene a Jazz en la Costa, por primera vez, acompañada de un excelente músico: Irving Mayfield, que representa el legado del jazz de Nueva Orleans. Ganador de un Grammy y de numerosos premios, este versátil trompetista, líder de banda, compositor, arreglista, profesor, embajador cultural y miembro del Consejo Nacional de la Artes de Estados Unidos, nombrado por Barack Obama, está en el camino de situarse en el centro de la cultura americana. Su virtuosismo y devoción a la música ha hecho que Mayfield sea uno de los más admirados y respetados entre los músicos de su generación.\n\nDee Dee Bridgewater, voz\nIrvin Mayfield, voz\nMichael

Née à Memphis au début des années 50, c’est d’abord dans l’orchestre de son père Matthew Garret qu’elle illumine la scène de sa présence. Vingt ans plus tard, elle rencontre le trompettiste Cecil Bridgewater, dont elle gardera le nom, et devient le sourire de l'orchestre de Thad Jones et Mel Lewis. Dans le même temps de Dizzy Gillespie à Sonny Rollins, la chanteuse donne la réplique aux plus grands. C'est en 1984, lors des représentations au Théâtre du Châtelet de la tournée européenne de Sophisticated Lady, qu’elle découvre Paris et va choisir de résider dans la ville lumière. Enfin en 89, quand sur la romance de Precious thing elle conjugue ses inflexions chaudes au timbre brisé de Ray Charles, Dee Dee Bridgewater connaîtra les hauteurs du classement mondial. Près de quatre décennies de chant jalonnées par des rendez-vous discographiques et dont le dernier, Dee Dee’s Feathers, sonne comme un retour aux sources du Mississipi. Des titres qui nous emmènent en Louisiane, au pied d’un berceau du jazz fortement secoué après le passage de l’ouragan Katrina. Des grands classiques et quelques compositions originales qui, dix ans après, nous transportent dans le quartier historique de Treme pour un hommage moderne à la musique de la Nouvelle Orléans.\n \t \npresse\t \n«C’est une nouvelle aventure qui s’écrit pour Dee Dee Bridgewater avec ce splendide album gorgé de swing aux savoureuses couleurs musicales de la Nouvelle-Orléans.»\nFrance

eigenen Aussage nach konnte sie scatten, also auf ganz spezielle Art singen, bevor sie zu sprechen begann. Heute gilt Dee Dee Bridgewater als legitime Nachfolgerin von Ella Fitzgerald. Zweifellos steht die vielfach preisgekrönte amerikanische Jazzsängerin und Schauspielerin in einer Reihe mit Größen wie Nina Simone oder Billie Holiday – und seit bei-nahe 50 Jahren auf der Bühne. Dort geht die Entertainerin mit dem Tonkünstler-Orchester Niederösterreich eine Verbindung ein. Deren Ergebnis ist ein Repertoire aus Songs von Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington und Tony Bennett.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee

Dee Dee Bridgewater és una de les realitats tangibles en el món del jazz vocal en l’actualitat i el seu futur es preveu molt millor. Nascuda a Memphis, al maig de 1950, com a Denese Garrett -va adquirir el seu nom artístic al 1970 després de casar-se amb el trompetista Cecil Bridgewater- es va incorporar el 1971 a la Big Band de Thad Jones i Mel Lewis, una brillantíssima i innovadora orquestra amb la qual va realitzar nombroses actuacions fins ben entrat l’any 1974. Allí va adquirir la formació suficient per donar un salt de qualitat en la seva carrera i col·laborar amb els grups de les figures consagrades del jazz: Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, i Dexter Gordon.  Entre els anys 1974 i 1976 va treballar en un musical de Broadway, titulat The Witz, amb el qual va aconseguir un important premi teatral. Aquesta faceta interpretativa va continuar fins a la seva participació a l’obra d’Stephen Sthal, titulada Lady Day, interpretant a Billie Holiday, que es va representar a Hamburg, Londres i París i a la revista musical Sophisticated Lady sobre la música de Duke Ellington.  Instal·lada a París des de mitjan anys vuitanta, ha gravat ja nombrosos i importants discs on s’observa l’enorme influència en el seu estil de les cantants Nancy Wilson i la pròpia Sarah Vaughan. Des del blues a l’scatt, passant pels estàndards o els discs en directe, Dee Dee Bridgewater va pel camí de fer història en el món del jazz vocal i el seu registre en directe en el club Yoshi’s de Tokio és tot un recital de saber cantar. A més, el 1997 va rebre el Grammy Award com a ‘Best Jazz Vocal Performance’.  Pocs artistes han destacat amb aquesta rellevància en diferents medis artístics com ella. Menys encara s’han vist recompensats amb el premi de Broadway, Tony (Millor actriu en un Musical – The Wiz), nominada pel teatre londinenc West End, al Laurence Oliver Award (Millor Actriu en un musical – Lady Day), va guanyar dos premis Grammy Awards (Millor 1998’s Jazz Vocal Performance i Millor Arranjament Vocal d’acompanyament per “Cottontail” – Slide Hampton, arranjador – “Dear Ella”), i el 1998 el màxim guardó de França, Victoire de la Musique (Millor Àlbum Vocal de Jazz).  Dee Dee ha captivat els cors de les audiències de tot el món amb The Wiz amb la seva cançó If you Relieve. Segons Nick Ashford d’Ashford i Simpson l’entrega de Dee Dee, “personifica una generació i ens dóna esperança”.  Com Ambaixadora de Jazz, es banyava en la seva música abans de poder caminar. La seva mare escoltava els millors discs d’Ella Fitzgerald, l’art de la qual sempre ha estat una inspiració per a Dee Dee en el transcurs de la seva carrera. El seu pare era un trompetista que ensenyava música -a Booker Little, Charles Lloyd i George Coleman, entre d’altres. És el tipus d’entorn que deixa petja en una adolescent, sobre tot en una que va aparèixer en solitari i amb un trio tan bon punt va poder. Dee Dee va fer una una gira per la Unió Soviètica el 1969 amb la Universitat d’Illinois Big Band. Un any més tard, seguia el seu marit, Cecil Bridgewater, a Nova York.  Dee Dee va fer un debut fenomenal a Nova York el 1970 com a vocalista de la banda liderada per Thad Jones i Mel Lewis, una de les millors orquestres de jazz d’aquella època. Aquests anys a Nova York estan marcats amb concerts i gravacions amb gegants com Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Max Roach i Kirk Roland, a més d’experiències tan enriquidores amb en Norman Connors, Stanley Clarke i Frank Foster “Loud Minority”.  Dee Dee no creu massa en les etiquetes, i el 1974 va tenir l’oportunitat d’actuar i cantar a Broadway on la seva veu, bellesa i presència a l’escenari la van fer guanyar molt d’èxit i un premi Tony pel seu paper de  Glinda la Bruixa Bona, a The Wiz. Això va suposar l’inici d’una llarga llista de premis i guardons, així com d’oportunitats de feina a Tokio, Los Ángeles, París i a Londres, on va obtenir el cobejat premi “Laurence Olivier” nominació al premi com a Millor Actriu pel seu retrat de la llegenda del jazz Billie Holiday. Iniciativa en la qual s’exigeixen per igual interpretació i cant com Sophisticated Ladies, Cosmopolitan Greetings, Black Ballad, Carmen Jazz and the musical Cabaret (la primera actriu negra en interpretar-lo va ser Rally Bowles), així va obtenir la seva reputació com a artista consumada.  A l’octubre de 1999, va ser nomenada AMBAIXADORA DE LES NACIONS UNIDES, Agricultura i Alimentació (FAO), Dee Dee es va unir a la lluita contra la fam al món. Apel·lant a la solidaritat internacional per finançar projectes globals de base, l’ajuda als ambaixadors de la FAO en el desenvolupament de l’autosuficiència, la conservació a llarg termini i gestió de l’agricultura sostenible, el desenvolupament rural, la conservació i gestió de recursos naturals.  Fent-se càrrec dels regnes de JAZZSET de l’il·lustre Bradford Marsalis, Dee Dee continua apropant el seu missatge als oients.  Al 2015 va editar el seu últim CD, en col·laboració amb Irvin Mayfield i la New Orleans Jazz Orchestra.

her New York debut in 1970, Dee Dee Bridgewater has enjoyed nearly half a century in a career that’s yielded three Grammy wins, a Tony Award and the unique distinction of being a United Nations Cultural Ambassador in the fight against global hunger. Bridgewater has appeared live and in studio with such giants as Sonny Rollins and Dizzy Gillespie, having worked in Tokyo, London, Los Angeles and Paris, where she won France’s 1998 top jazz honor, Victoire de la Musique. Taking over the reins of Jazzset from the illustrious Branford Marsalis, Dee Dee now acts as the jazz lover’s ears and eyes on the genre’s premiere radio program.\n\nThis sparkling ambassador for jazz will be joined by Order Of Canada Member Phil Dwyer, who burst onto the international jazz scene in his late teens.  Dubbed a saxophone prodigy by his early 20s, Dwyer sought out the action and excitement of New York City as a young man, where he met and sat in with some of the true jazz legends, including Art Blakey, “Philly” Joe Jones and Rashid Ali.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Harvest Jazz & Blues Fest","place":"The Playhouse Fredericton","city":"Fredericton","region":"NB","country":"Canada","latitude":45.960139,"longitude":-66.636816},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":12555300,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":15717749,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ The Appel Room in New York, NY","datetime":"2016-09-23T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, September 23, 2016 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12555300?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":" Grammy and Tony Award-winning superstar Dee Dee Bridgewater takes you through 100 years of jazz song in our season-opening weekend of Singers Over Manhattan. On Friday (9/23), she will be joined by music director/trumpeter Riley Mulherkar and his ensemble; Vuyo Sotashe, finalist of the 2015 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocals Competition; and Brianna Thomas, whom The Wall Street Journal says \"may well be the best young straight-ahead jazz singer of her generation.\" Combining their distinct talents, the group will sing their way through four decades of music, beginning with the early blues and jazz of the 1920s and ending in the early 1950s. Iconic singers to be explored include Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Washington, and Sarah Vaughan. The band also features Tatum Greenblatt, Mariel Bildsten, Patrick Bartley, Julian Lee, Lucas Pino, Gabe Schnider, Mathis Picard, Russell Hall, and Sammy Miller. On Saturday (9/24), Bridgewater returns with a new group, featuring a band led by music director/drummer Ulysses Owens, Jr.; the thoughtfully eclectic Theo Bleckmann, who exemplifies the notion of \"voice as instrument,\" and Brooklyn's own internationally rising star Alicia Olatuja, known for navigating jazz traditions with a taste of gospel and R&B. They will perform the socially conscious music of the 1950s through today, featuring the works of Nina Simone, Abbey Lincoln, and Joni Mitchell. The band also features Allyn Johnson, Larry Genadier, and David Rosenthal. The band features Each of these two nights will be a completely unique program, and passionate fans can attend both for a century-spanning, comprehensive experience.  Free pre-concert discussions nightly, 6pm and 8:30pm.  Join our family! Our members and subscribers gain early access to concerts such as this one. Membership starts at $75 and offers benefits, invitations and more throughout the season. Subscribers purchase three or more concerts annually for priority seating and discounted tickets.

Last seen in 2013 as part of the Monterey Jazz Festival on Tour, the stylish vocalist is now joined by young trumpet innovator and collaborator Theo Croker.\n\nBridgewater began her jazz career in the ‘70s and has since performed with all the greats—Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and more. Croker is an artist who spent seven years in Shanghai broadening his concept of jazz to encompass salsa, rock, R&B, hip hop, and blues. The two hit it off with the 2014 album Afro Physicist, an ambitious and stylistically wide-ranging collaboration that illuminates both the emerging prodigies and established veterans of American jazz.\n\n“The palpable synergy and exuberant creative juice flowing between Croker and Bridgewater here are what make Afro Physicist a truly alchemic experience.” – Matt Collar,

The show is helmed by Grammy Award®-winning drummer, composer, and producer Terri Lyne Carrington.\n\nAbbey Lincoln was beloved for her powerful and unique voice, as well as for pursuing her art with integrity and turning music into a genuine celebration of life. Lincoln asked her friend Dee Dee Bridgewater to help keep her songbook of recorded albums alive. On May 20, 2011, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., Bridgewater began to fulfill her promise with this program. The performance highlights President John F. Kennedy’s value of justice, which is encompassed in Abbey Lincoln’s outspoken and endless fight for rights in the 1960s.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":215755,"name":"Terri Lyne Carrington","mbid":"7062af1b-b491-40a2-9d82-77dd63a33dcb","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TerriLyneCarrington/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/TerriLyneCarrington","tracker_count":6768,"url":"TerriLyneCarrington","website":"http://www.terrilynecarrington.com/"},{"id":46306,"name":"Esperanza Spalding","mbid":"5c12b265-5e59-44e0-b657-5cf4169f7316","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/EsperanzaSpalding/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Esperanza%20Spalding/279919320526","tracker_count":124752,"url":"EsperanzaSpalding","website":"http://www.esperanzaspalding.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Kimmel Center","place":"Kimmel Center","city":"Philadelphia","region":"PA","country":"United States","latitude":39.946935,"longitude":-75.164791},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":13544555,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":18023042,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Apollo Theater in New York, NY","datetime":"2017-05-06T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-12-21T20:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13544555?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"Celebrating NEA Jazz Master Abbey Lincoln with a concert tribute featuring four of today's leading jazz artists: Dee Dee Bridgewater, Terri Lyne Carrington, Dianne Reeves, and Esperanza Spalding.

Elle se frotte également aux comédies musicales, ce qui l’amène en Europe au milieu des années ’80.

Dee Dee Bridgewater has earned this distinction—and three Grammy Awards—in part, by mastering the same qualities as her predecessors: thinking more like an instrumentalist than a vocalist, scatting well-constructed yet improvised melodies, and interpreting songs in an original and personal way. Named a 2017 National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, she is set apart by an uncommon but perfectly natural talent for communicating with an audience—a charisma that led to a Tony for her theatrical performance in The Wiz and international recognition as a leading light of the jazz vocal tradition. Bridgewater thrilled Festival audiences in 2004, and she and her band are returning to do it again.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Spoleto Festival","place":"College of Charleston Cistern Yard","city":"Charleston","region":"SC","country":"United States","latitude":32.78371,"longitude":-79.937256},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":14210484,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":18024098,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC","datetime":"2017-05-26T21:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, May 26, 2017 at 9:00PM","formatted_location":"Charleston, SC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14210484?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"Few singers successfully carry the torch passed on by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, and Betty Carter.

Dee Dee fa parte della storia del festival, e viceversa: nel 1973 era una ragazza che cantava nella notevolissima Orchestra di Thad Jones e Mel Lewis che apri' la prima edizione. Nessuno allora poteva immaginare che da grande Dee Dee Bridgewater sarebbe diventata una star, vincitrice di tre Grammy e un Tony Awards, completamente a suo agio nei concerti e nelle piece teatrali, fortemente impegnata nella lotta per i diritti civili e lo sviluppo tanto da essere nominata ambasciatrice della FAO.\nAdesso, dopo tanti omaggi a primedonne del jazz, da Ella Fitzgerald a Billie Holiday, il suo nuovo progetto discografico ed il relativo tour promozionale sono dedicati alla musica di Memphis, Tennessee, che è la sua città natale ed è anche una delle grandi capitali della musica americana. Il programma della serata promette grandi classici di blues, soul, r&b, da Al Green a Bobby Blue Bland.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Umbria Jazz","place":"Arena Santa Giuliana","city":"Perugia Pg","region":"Italy","country":"Italy","latitude":43.11147,"longitude":12.388424},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":14212455,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":18027109,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ St. Raphaël Festival des Jazz in Saint-Raphaël, France","datetime":"2017-07-11T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Saint-Raphaël, France","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14212455?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"St. Raphaël Festival des Jazz","place":"St. Raphaël Festival des Jazz","city":"Saint-Raphaël","region":"B8","country":"France","latitude":43.424992,"longitude":6.7685},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":14212564,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":18027373,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Jazz Open Stuttgart in Stuttgart, Germany","datetime":"2017-07-16T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, July 16, 2017 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Stuttgart, Germany","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14212564?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"QUINCY JONES & FRIENDS | FEAT.

Recorded at Willie Mitchell’s historic Royal Studios.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":14856254,"name":"Memphis Soulphony","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MemphisSoulphony/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"MemphisSoulphony","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater presents \"Memphis...

Jetzt kehrt Dee Dee Bridgewater musikalisch nach Memphis, Tennessee zurück, wo sie am 27. Mai 1950 geboren wurde. Ihre Kindheit war geprägt vom Radio-Sender WDIA, der als erster in Amerika ein rein schwarzes Programm spielte und wo auch ihr Vater als \"Matt the Platter Cat\" heute legendäre R′n′B-Klassiker auflegte. Wie stets begleitet von einer astreinen Band, präsentiert die grandiose Vokalistin nun also ihre Interpretation der Hitparade von Motown und Stax, wobei Songs wie \"I Can′t Stand the Rain\" (Ann Peeples), \"Try a Little Tenderness\" (Otis Redding) oder \"Giving Up\" (Gladys Knight & the Pips) nicht fehlen dürfen.

Nacida en Memphis, en mayo de 1950, como Denese Garrett, -adquirió su nombre artístico en 1970 tras su matrimonio con el trompetista Cecil Bridgewater- se incorporó en 1971 a la Big Band de Thad Jones y Mel Lewis, una brillantísima e innovadora orquesta con la que realizó numerosas actuaciones hasta bien entrado el año 1974. Allí adquirió la formación suficiente para dar un salto de calidad en su carrera y colaborar en los grupos de las figuras consagradas del jazz: Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins o Dexter Gordon. Entre los años 1974-1976, trabajó en un musical de Broadway, titulado The Wiz, por el que conquistó un importante premio teatral. Esta faceta interpretativa continuó con su participación en la obra de Stephen Sthal, titulada Lady Day, interpretando a la mismísima, Billie Holiday, que se representó en Hamburgo, Londres y París y en la revista musical Sophisticated Lady sobre la música de Duke Ellington. Afincada en París desde mediados de los ochenta, ha grabado numerosos e importantes discos donde se observa la enorme influencia en su estilo de las cantantes Nancy Wilson y la propia Sarah Vaughan. Desde el blues al scatt, pasando por los standars o los discos en directo, Dee Dee Bridgewater lleva camino de hacer historia en el mundo del jazz vocal y su registro en directo en el club Yoshi’s de Tokio es todo un recital de saber cantar. Además en 1997 recibió el Grammy Award como ‘Best Jazz Vocal Performance’. Pocos artistas han destacado con tal profundidad en diferentes medios artísticos y, menos aún, se han visto recompensados con el codiciado premio Tony, en Broadway, (Mejor actriz en un musical – The Wiz); además, ha sido nominada al Laurence Oliver Award en el teatro londinense West End (Mejor Actriz en un musical – Lady Day), ha ganado dos premios Grammy Awards (Mejor 1998’s Jazz Vocal Performance y Mejor Arreglo Vocal de acompañamiento para “Cottontail” – Slide Hampton, arreglista – “Dear Ella”) y, en 1998, le otorgaron el máximo galardón de Francia, Victoire de la Musique (Mejor Álbum Vocal de Jazz). Dee Dee ha capturado los corazones de las audiencias en todo el mundo en The Wiz con su canción If you Believe.

Originaire de Memphis, celle qui en quarante années d’une immense carrière international a brillamment honoré de son charisme radieux toutes les facettes du jazz – donnant la réplique à Ray Charles, Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie et plus récemment Irvin Mayfield – nous plonge désormais aux sources du blues ! Tour à tour drôle et charmeuse, insaisissable et imprévisible, enjôleuse et survoltée, elle se mue avec brio dans la peau des ces grandes divas des années 60. Quoi de plus évident pour cette fille spirituelle de Billie Holiday et d’Ella Fitzgerald ? Entourée de six musiciens et de deux choristes, la reine du jazz au scat inventif et puissamment rythmique pourrait bien s’assurer avec ce nouvel album un quatrième Grammy Awards… Une artiste exceptionnelle!","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":14856254,"name":"Memphis Soulphony","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MemphisSoulphony/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"MemphisSoulphony","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"19e Blues sur Seine","place":"Théâtre Simone Signoret ","city":"Conflans-Sainte-Honorine","region":"A8","country":"France","latitude":48.9833333,"longitude":2.1},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":15398124,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":19674287,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Le Carré Sainte Maxime in Sainte-Maxime, France","datetime":"2017-11-11T20:30:37","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, November 11, 2017 at 8:30PM","formatted_location":"Sainte-Maxime, France","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15398124?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee Bridgewater","mbid":"43826bcf-2c17-4bf5-92cf-671c184e215f","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8392836.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8392836.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DeeDeeBridgewater/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deedeebridgewater","tracker_count":11322,"url":"DeeDeeBridgewater","website":"http://www.deedeebridgewater.com/"},{"id":14856254,"name":"Memphis Soulphony","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MemphisSoulphony/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"MemphisSoulphony","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Le Carré Sainte Maxime","place":"Le Carré Sainte Maxime","city":"Sainte-Maxime","region":"Paca","country":"France","latitude":43.32495,"longitude":6.62431},"ontour_id":"n8S4grLWa5ozDtE28","genres":["cabaret","jazz christmas","vocal jazz"]},{"id":15871582,"artist_id":48312,"artist_event_id":19680022,"title":"Dee Dee Bridgewater @ Megaron The Athens Concert Hall  in Athens, Greece","datetime":"2017-11-13T20:00:55","formatted_datetime":"Monday, November 13, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Athens, Greece","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15871582?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Dee+Dee+Bridgewater&came_from=67","description":"Dee Dee Bridgewater presents \"Memphis...

the course of a multifaceted career spanning four decades, Grammy and Tony Award-winning jazz giant Dee Dee Bridgewater has ascended to the upper echelon of vocalists, putting her unique spin on beloved standards. Ever the fearless pioneer and keeper of tradition, the three-time Grammy winner has performed with such jazz notables as Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, and Dizzy Gillespie. All but one of her self-produced albums has been nominated for Grammy Awards, including her double Grammy-winning tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, Dear Ella.  Bridgewater has also pursued a parallel career in musical theater, winning a Tony Award for her role as “Glinda” in The Wiz in 1975. Her other theatrical credits include Sophisticated Ladies, Cabaret and the Off-Broadway and West End productions of Lady Day, for which Bridgewater received the British Laurence Olivier Nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.  Bridgewater’s latest studio album is 2017’s Memphis… Yes, I’m Ready. At Winter Fest 2018, she’ll perform songs spanning the course of her acclaimed career with the San Jose State University Jazz Orchestra under the direction of Dr. Aaron Lington.  High School All Stars, San Jose Jazz’s audition-based big band, will open this special evening at 6pm.","artists":[{"id":48312,"name":"Dee Dee
