Then there's Jackie Greene. Nimbly sidestepping the inherent corniness of too many contemporary twang-mongers, Greene has used his association with the jam scene — he's played with various Grateful Dead survivors and toured with Gov't Mule — to spread his bone-deep and abiding love of rootsy American songcraft. Rather than being a study in formalism, though, his music has a knack for bending tradition to suit his own fluid and soulful melodic sense.","artists":[{"id":5118,"name":"Jackie

touring as a member of the final lineup of the Black Crowes, consummate roots rocker Jackie Greene returned to solo form with last year's \"Back To Birth\".

Greene draws his influences from vintage rock, country, blues and R&B and has opened for such greats as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi and Taj Mahal. He'll perform songs from throughout his illustrious musical career in concert at The Warfield in San Francisco.","artists":[{"id":5118,"name":"Jackie

You’ll experience four unforgettable nights of music on the beach: Bill Kreutzmann & Bob Weir with Dave Schools, Jeff Chimenti and Tom Hamilton (3 nights), The String Cheese Incident (3 nights), The Chris Robinson Brotherhood (1 night), an intimate, acoustic performance by Chris Robinson and Neal Casal, and much more. The Caribbean Sea provides a gorgeous backdrop for these beachfront concerts, with the state-of-the art stage just feet away from the clear blue waters.","artists":[{"id":5118,"name":"Jackie Greene","mbid":"a1a053b3-cad1-43c2-8234-29367a9a42a3","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7947915.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7947915.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JackieGreene/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/jackie.greene.music","tracker_count":41522,"url":"JackieGreene","website":"http://jackiegreene.com"},{"id":14226032,"name":"Bill Kreutzmann + Bob Weir","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BillKreutzmannPlusBobWeir/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"BillKreutzmannPlusBobWeir","website":null},{"id":5524,"name":"The String Cheese Incident","mbid":"cff95140-6d57-498a-8834-10eb72865b29","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheStringCheeseIncident/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/stringcheeseincident","tracker_count":166719,"url":"TheStringCheeseIncident","website":"http://www.stringcheeseincident.com"},{"id":2888811,"name":"Chris robinson band","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ChrisRobinsonBand/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":23,"url":"ChrisRobinsonBand","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Los Muertos Con Queso","place":"Playa Azul","city":"Maya","region":"20","country":"Mexico","latitude":16.7666667,"longitude":-96.5333333},"ontour_id":"gcNnfW2Ct3cqZYCw5","genres":["alternative country","jam band","modern blues","new americana","progressive bluegrass","roots rock"]},{"id":13114596,"artist_id":5118,"artist_event_id":17333915,"title":"Jackie Greene @ Le Poisson Rouge in New York, NY","datetime":"2017-02-03T23:45:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, February 3, 2017 at 11:45PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13114596?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jackie+Greene&came_from=67","description":"Doors: 6:30 PM // Show: 7:00 PM","artists":[{"id":5118,"name":"Jackie Greene","mbid":"a1a053b3-cad1-43c2-8234-29367a9a42a3","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7947915.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7947915.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JackieGreene/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/jackie.greene.music","tracker_count":41522,"url":"JackieGreene","website":"http://jackiegreene.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Le Poisson Rouge","place":"Le Poisson Rouge","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.7284849,"longitude":-73.9999332},"ontour_id":"gcNnfW2Ct3cqZYCw5","genres":["alternative country","jam band","modern blues","new americana","progressive bluegrass","roots rock"]},{"id":13353896,"artist_id":5118,"artist_event_id":16805170,"title":"Jackie Greene @ Voodoo Dead feat.
