The band is a living organism, cells of piano, percussion, trombones, trumpet and choir churning to make up a body. It's a bright, jubilant life form, with an outer layer that’s been seen, in the wild, in technicolor. On October 17 at the Granada Theater, the band is marking the 15th anniversary of the debut LP The Beginning Stages Of. It’s been 15 years since the white robes of “Light & Day.” A decade-plus-five-years since “Soldier Girl.” So, you know, we’re pretty damn old. Once, at an early 2000s show in Deep Ellum, I saw the Polyphonic Spree’s concert open with a Russian folk band that played a bass the size of the door. The Russian band sang “She’ll Be Coming ‘Round the Mountain.” It was weird and wild, like all of Polyphonic’s luminescent shows. That's why Granada’s show will be a can’t-miss: The Spree is performing their debut album in its entirety. After that the band will move to Austin, and then end a fall/winter tour at our own Majestic Theatre. This will be fun.

An act perhaps best experienced live, Polyphonic Spree combines about 15 horns, keys, strings and woodwinds to conjure something magically whimsical and totally refreshing.","artists":[{"id":4793,"name":"The Polyphonic
