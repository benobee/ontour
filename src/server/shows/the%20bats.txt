Lexington Herald-Leader described The Bats as “a best bet.” After all, it’s not often that Rock ‘n Roll meets Cabaret meets Comedy, all done with tight vocal harmonies and skillful musicianship. As one audience member put it, “it’s a magical combination.” The Bats promise to make you laugh and get your feet moving. They sing of love lost, weight gained, the pangs of growing older, the joys of retail therapy, and everything else life throws their way. Singer/songwriter Kim Berryman, vocalists Missy Johnston, Marilyn Robie, and Susan Thomas hold the front line, blending beautiful harmonies into hilariously entertaining songs and patter. Marianne Sherman adds earthy humor, a booming bass line and a growing list of original Bats’ tunes.

ans tout juste après la sortie de leur premier disque, le groupe pop néo-zélandais The Bats vient présenter à Petit Bain son neuvième album \"The Deep Set\".\n\nDès 18h sur la terrasse en accès libre : Buddy Records DJ set \n\nTHE BATS\n\n5 ans après la sortie de leur dernier disque, The Bats reviennent avec leur neuvième album \"The Deep Set\". Un titre qui vient rappeler le temps passé et les 30 ans qui séparent le groupe de l’enregistrement de leur premier album \"Daddy’s Highway\" dans le salon d’un ami d’ami à Glasgow.\n\nThe Bats sont fidèles à eux-mêmes : les guitares carillonnent, sautillent, les mélodies sont toujours claires et mémorables, la section rythmique intraitable. Le groupe continue cependant à cultiver le son plus sombre et plus profond que \"Free All The Monsters\" (2011) s’employait déjà à révéler. Au programme donc des chansons toujours songeuses et accrocheuses mais une musique plus complexe et plus riche.\n\nNous emportant du soleil de Taieri River vers l’obscur Durkestan, et achevant son périple dans le contexte politique de la Nouvelle-Zélande contemporaine, \"The Deep Set\" constitue un des plus convaincants recueils de The Bats. Bien que moins vulnérables et immédiats que sur leur désormais classique premier album, les Bats du 21ème siècle parviennent cependant à être plus intimes et plus urgents.\n\nFRANÇOIS VIROT\n\nFrançois Virot sort son premier album non gravé sur CD-R. A la question \"Yes Or No\", la critique et le public répondent : proposition n°1. On loue le geste nerveux et les mélodies titubantes de cette folk pop lo-fi, on le traite d’Animal Collective à lui tout seul. On le tire de l’invisibilité des squats lyonnais pour le faire monter sur scène. Personne ne se rend compte à quel point il n’est pas prêt. Pour cet hyperactif tombé tout petit dans le songwriting, la naïveté n’est pas un calcul, le DIY pas un gadget esthétique. Le miel du premier buzz est amer.\n\nFrançois Virot est au générique de deux des plus beaux disques de l’année 2016. Après le troisième album de Clara Clara (‘Bugarach’), plus pop chatoyant que jamais, retour à la sobriété pour un deuxième album solo qu’on n’avait, malgré tout, jamais cessé d’attendre. Un disque qui est à la fois un condensé laidback de sa discographie, une actualisation de ses obsessions (batteries truculentes, mélodies catchy-mais-vicelardes, télescopage référentiel – Police vs. The Ex vs. Joe Dassin ?), et une déclaration de non-allégeance aux lois indie actuelles. ‘Marginal Spots’, c’est du François Virot à l’os, aveugle aux mirages de la hype, branché directement sur les emballements de son cœur.\n\nVUNDABAR\n\nVundabar est la nouvelle sensation surf rock américaine. L’effronté trio vous embringuera vers des plages pop garage aux sonorités brutes, sex & sun. Ces jeunes adeptes des larsens bien sentis sont d’un talent fou. Au volant de leur décapotable sonique aux mélodies éhontées et terriblement sexy, ils déploient un rock nonchalant quelque part entre Weezer et les Pixies.","artists":[{"id":73321,"name":"The Bats","mbid":"12d6d781-4a3f-42d4-89d4-b64d875c1257","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7762535.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7762535.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheBats/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thebats.co.nz/","tracker_count":5267,"url":"TheBats","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Petit Bain","place":"Petit Bain","city":"Paris","region":"A8","country":"France","latitude":48.8329289,"longitude":2.3793696},"ontour_id":"v8RtoMdMEkYF5fNsA","genres":["c86","jangle pop","kiwi rock","nz indie","twee pop"]},{"id":14006264,"artist_id":73321,"artist_event_id":18059421,"title":"The Bats @ Brudenell Social Club in Leeds, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-06-14T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Leeds, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-02-24T09:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14006264?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Bats&came_from=67","description":"Japanese noise rock band Melt Banana found more success in the U.S. and the U.K. than in their own country, gaining a small but dedicated fan base among American and European punk rock fans. Although their music sounds noticeably different from any sort of traditional punk, it contains some punk elements: shrieking vocals, overdriven guitars, and one-and-a-half-minute songs. Melt Banana's unique style, however, comes as a result of the distinctly piercing vocals of lead singer Yasuko O., as well as the frenzied, effect-charged playing of guitarist Agata. Searing, intense, and mind-blowingly fast are perhaps the first adjectives that come to mind when listening to Melt Banana's music. Try to imagine an even more energetic incarnation of the Boredoms.\nBut, for many, the appeal of Melt Banana is not entirely limited to their music. Yasuko O.'s lyrics and song titles reflect a Japanese pop culture that is fascinating and strange, yet attractive to many non-Japanese fans. Melt Banana have capitalized on this phenomenon heavily in their merchandising as well as on their albums. As time passes, their overshadowing influence is becoming more and more evident within the cultish following of the noise-core movement. However, Melt Banana have gained the most recognition from their incredible severity and furious sound. Their shockingly intense live shows are that of sheer legend, with many fans leaving sweaty and exhausted, and Yasuko O. often persevering through nosebleeds.\n\nAgata and O. joined bassist Rika in 1992, and they played as a trio until later that year when drummer Sudoh Toshiakijoined the group. In 1994 they signed with British label Chocolate Monk, and that label released one title, Cactuses Come in Flocks, which was initially made available only on cassette tape. They later signed to Skin Graft and released their second album that year, Speak Squeak Creak, followed by Scratch or Stitch in 1995. Scratch or Stitch was recorded and mixed by Chicago avant-garde masters Steve Albini and Jim O'Rourke, and showcases some of Melt Banana's best work.\n\nAfter releasing a large number of split releases on various labels, late in 1997 Melt Banana started their own label, A-Zap Records. Toshiaki quit the band the following month and was later replaced with Oshima from Satanic Hell Slaughter. In 1998, the band released Charlie, with Albini acting as producer again, and elected to up the ante by adding a variety of guests (including Mr. Bungle's Mike Patton and Trevor Dunn). This attracted the attention of Bungle producer and noise experimentalist John Zorn, who captured one of their wild shows for his Tzadik label that year, just before Melt Banana returned to the studio to record the typically crazed Teeny Shiny in 2000.\n\nSix more split records and a Peel session later, they released 2003's Cell-Scape, which focused more on slowly building the wailing screeches into a rocketing ferocity. The 2005 release 13 Hedgehogs compiled 56 tracks from six years' worth of the band's numerous 7\" EPs and split releases. After their longest recording break, Melt Banana returned in 2007 with Bambi's Dilemma, which reverted back to even shorter, faster blasts of musical adrenaline. Two years later, the band returned with the guitarless side project album Lite Live: Ver.0.0. In 2011, the band's recording sessions were stalled after the Tohoku earthquake and subsequent meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant made progress difficult. When Melt Banana did finally return with 2013's Fetch, O. and Agata had stripped the band back to a duo format. Return of 13 Hedgehogs, the group's second singles retrospective (covering the years 2000 to 2009), appeared in 2015.","artists":[{"id":73321,"name":"The Bats","mbid":"12d6d781-4a3f-42d4-89d4-b64d875c1257","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7762535.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7762535.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheBats/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thebats.co.nz/","tracker_count":5267,"url":"TheBats","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Brudenell Social Club","place":"Brudenell Social Club","city":"Leeds","region":"United Kingdom","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":53.809667,"longitude":-1.570182},"ontour_id":"v8RtoMdMEkYF5fNsA","genres":["c86","jangle pop","kiwi rock","nz indie","twee pop"]},{"id":14047112,"artist_id":73321,"artist_event_id":17799748,"title":"The Bats @ Broadcast in Glasgow, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-06-15T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-03-01T15:45:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14047112?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Bats&came_from=67","description":"The Bats","artists":[{"id":73321,"name":"The Bats","mbid":"12d6d781-4a3f-42d4-89d4-b64d875c1257","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7762535.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7762535.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheBats/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thebats.co.nz/","tracker_count":5267,"url":"TheBats","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Broadcast","place":"Broadcast","city":"Glasgow","region":"Scotland","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":55.866047,"longitude":-4.26884},"ontour_id":"v8RtoMdMEkYF5fNsA","genres":["c86","jangle pop","kiwi rock","nz indie","twee pop"]},{"id":14011866,"artist_id":73321,"artist_event_id":17747615,"title":"The Bats @ The Dome, Tufnell Park in London, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-06-17T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"London, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-02-25T13:30:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14011866?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Bats&came_from=67","description":"THE BATS presented by Dictionary Pudding","artists":[{"id":73321,"name":"The Bats","mbid":"12d6d781-4a3f-42d4-89d4-b64d875c1257","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7762535.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7762535.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheBats/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thebats.co.nz/","tracker_count":5267,"url":"TheBats","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"The Dome, Tufnell Park","place":"The Dome, Tufnell Park","city":"London","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.5579086,"longitude":-0.1390398},"ontour_id":"v8RtoMdMEkYF5fNsA","genres":["c86","jangle pop","kiwi rock","nz indie","twee pop"]}]
