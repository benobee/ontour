With 9  full length albums, 2 EPs, and numerous soundtracks to her credit, she has spent the last 15 years crafting a reputation as an original musical voice and compelling live performer. \nAn active voice on social justice issues and culture, Erin was a 2011-12 fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Recently, she’s also added radio to her resume- blogging and hosting for WNYC New York Public Radio. A former board member of the Future of Music Coalition, McKeown also works closely with Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) on immigration issues. \n2015 finds McKeown in high demand as a teacher with a full studio of private students, and she has three records for other artists in production. She is currently writing an original musical with Tony & Pulitzer winner Quiara Alegria Hudes for the world renowned La Jolla Playhouse. Her most recent record, MANIFESTRA (2013), is her seventh studio album and the first to originate on her own TVP. \n\n\nGiven McKeown’s well known activism around musician compensation and technology, the choice of how to fund MANIFESTRA was obvious. Using the PledgeMusic platform, McKeown’s fans funded her project in a mere 6 days. In addition to covering recording and promotional costs, the fundraising campaign allowed Erin to make the first music video of her career.Fingers crossed for a new solo record in 2016. Meantime, read about her latest record, MANIFESTRA. \nMcKeown concludes, “At this point in my career, I am most concerned with cultivating relationships that are mutually fufilling. I want to give my fans the best possible music and experience. I have loved getting to know them better and better. I want to work with musicians who inspire me, and I want to provide opportunities for artists to collaborate in new ways. I want to learn how to be a better activist, and I want to be a part of my community. It is no longer enough for me to just make records and tour. I’ve got to do more.”   \nNew York-based modern folk/singer-songwriter Jen Zimberg opens the show. Her acclaimed EP, Arrow, released in December 2015, was produced by Erin McKeown. \n ","artists":[{"id":3473,"name":"Erin
