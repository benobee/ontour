Ward kommt im August 2017 nach München und Köln. Der in Kalifornien geborene Gitarrist, Sänger, Songwriter und Produzent kommt mit der Erscheinung seines achten Soloalbum „More Rain“, das unter anderem Gastbeiträge von u.a. R.E.M.s Peter Buck, Neko Case und k.d. Lang enthält, für zwei Konzerte zurück nach Deutschland.Bereits seit der Jahrtausendwende veröffentlicht der Ausnahmekünstler ein Album-Juwel nach dem anderen. Dabei verliert keines seiner Werke seine unverwechselbare Handschrift einer bittersüßen Melancholie. Überhaupt findet M. Ward für jedes neue Werk frische Ansätze und unkonventionelle Konzepte und stellt dabei die einzelnen Songs seines Albums oft in einen universelleren Gesamtzusammenhang. Fans in Köln und München dürfen sich also besonders auf diesen Sommer freuen.","artists":[{"id":1643,"name":"M.

Ward började sin musikaliska bana 1999, och har sedan dess givit oss ett antal album att älska. Hans musik är alltid travande lågmäld, men besitter kraften att både förtrolla och förändra.  Trots att han är en gitarrvirtuos av rang bjuder hans låtstycken alltid in, och det är inte allt för sällan som man vill stanna i dem för alltid. När M. Ward inte plinkar själv, är han även en del av duon She &amp; Him tillsammans med Zooey Deschanel och supergruppen Monsters of Folk. Med She &amp; Him har M. Ward gett oss sex album, som alla varit ett perfekt giftermål mellan Deschanels stämma och Ward vackra gitarrspel.  Nu kan vi meddela att M.

Ward has been creating the perfect soundtrack to quiet, introspective nights indoors, or long, winding solo walks. Now, armed with his hushed signature rasp and rambling guitar, Ward heads to L.A.'s Walt Disney Concert Hall to recreate all the same warmth and poignance of an intimate living room listen. He'll be joined by Americana singer-songwriter Rhiannon Giddens, whose musical genius is now officially on the books; she's one of this year's newly minted MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" recipients. The former Carolina Chocolate Drops front-woman has an unmistakable voice that rings loud and clear as a bell. She has the power to root you to the spot with covers and original pieces that borrow from blues, folk and country, as well as uniquely African-American sources like slave narratives and civil rights protest songs. As Ward delves into the folk, rock and doo-wop of his past pursuits, Giddens will get you hooked on her latest album, \"Freedom Highway\".","artists":[{"id":1643,"name":"M.
