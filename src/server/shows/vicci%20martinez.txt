The first NYC Pride Rally occurred one month after the Stonewall Riots in June 1969, when 500 people gathered for a “Gay Power” demonstration in Washington Square Park, followed by a candlelight vigil in Sheridan Square.\r\n\r\n NYC Pride continues the tradition of this event each year at various locations throughout the city. This year, the Rally will be held on Hudson River Park's Pier 26.\r\n\r\n Need a place to stay for The Rally?
