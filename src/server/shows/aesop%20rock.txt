&amp; DURANGO MASSIVE PRESENT\nAesop Rock w/ Rob Sonic, DJ Zone, Homeboy Sandman\n$25/$30\nTICKETS Onsale Date: Friday (3/25) AT SOUTHWEST SOUND AND ONLINE\n18+\nDOORS 8:30PM\n\n\n\nAesop Rock\nAesop Rock has started skateboarding again. Nearly every day, he hits up the skate park, working to get his skills back up.\nSkating and drawing (which he’s been doing more of, too) were his big passions before his hobby of making rap songs turned into a paying gig that turned into an accidental, 20­year long career, taking him from making beats in his bedroom to playing for crowds thousands deep. Going back to them just shy of 40­years old isn’t some kind of regressive midlife crisis move, though. It’s more like a way to help process everything that’s happened in his life over the past couple decades, and maybe to figure out the person he’s become. That’s also what he’s trying to do with his seventh solo album, The Impossible Kid.\nRap’s supposed to be a young man’s game, but Aesop’s only been improving as he’s gotten closer to middle age. He’s tackling different subject matter, going deep on topics like depression, his sometimes rocky relationships with his family, and the turbulent handful of years that culminated in Aesop leaving his adopted home of San Francisco to live in a barn out in the woods, where he recorded the foundations of The Impossible Kid.\nThose years have been productive, though. Since his last solo album, 2012’s Skelethon, Aesop has released collaborative albums with Kimya Dawson (The Uncluded’s Hokey Fright in 2013), with Rob Sonic (Hail Mary Mallon’s Bestiary in 2014, which was tracked in the same barn in the woods), and with Homeboy Sandman (LICE’s self­titled EP in 2015). He’s also been actively crafting beats. Recent projects include producing the 32+ minute instrumental mix, The Blob, working together with Nike to provide the music for a series of their skateboarding videos, and producing the soundtrack for the upcoming film Bushwick, starring Dave Bautista and Brittany Snow.\nNow comes The Impossible Kid, which finds Aesop still finding new ways to improve on the skills that have made him one of the kings of indie hip­hop. Part of the new creative process he brought to it includes a willingness to embrace the funny side that he kept quiet, when being taken as a serious lyricist was more of a priority. Combined with another newfound willingness to open up about his personal life, the bits of humor spiked throughout the album create a potent emotional cocktail. “Lotta Years” uses two short vignettes to meditate on outgrowing your corner of the culture while chuckling admiringly over the audacity of youth. “Blood Sandwich” recalls a couple of very weird scenes from his childhood starring his two brothers, told with the same combination of surreal comedy and genuine tenderness as a George Saunders story.\nAt the same time, this is the most purely Aesop Rock record of his career. Like Skelethon, Aesop exercised complete creative control over the whole thing, from the production (which he handled himself, with instrumental help from Philly’s Grimace Foundation) to conceptualizing the cover art by his friend Alex Pardee.\nAs you might have guessed, The Impossible Kid is a reference to Aesop himself, a person who’s spent his life doing things that seemed unthinkable before he just went and did them, blazing a visionary trail all his own. Two decades in, he’s still out there pushing it forward.\nRob Sonic\nLinks\nRob Sonic\nAsk ten different people in the know what they think about Rob Sonic, and you may very well get ten distinct and very interesting answers, though chances are the things they'll all agree on a few things, like \"amazing production\" or \"unbelievable lyrics\". Not a bad consensus. What we at Def Jux have known for a few years now, the rest of the music community is about to get their first real taste of, courtesy of Mr. Sonic himself and his seriously accomplished debut album, Telicatessen. We'll throw all the hackneyed cliché's at this one - 'tour de force', 'jaw-dropping', 'work of art', 'virtuoso performance', 'panoply of artistic accomplishment'- and you know what, they all kind of stick. Now that we've set unrealistic expectations for you, not to mention Rob, throw it all away and hear this album for what it really is: one man's musical journey through his mind, his experience and his reality of living in this day and age. It's a menu of musical exploration, with lyrics that will alternately tickle and confuse you (\"what the fuck did he just say?\") and beats that at times might just snap your neck, having gotten you so vigorously open. A masterpiece of focused abstraction, held tightly together by a commanding and confident flow, Telicatessen was completely self-produced using a variety of gear, both vintage and tech (ARP Odyssey, Little Brother, Mini Moog, Yamaha SK-20, Roland Juno 106, Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, Korg MS-2000, Akai MPC 2000 XL plus Technics 1200's courtesy of DJ's Big Wiz and Fred Ones), Rob Sonic has delivered one of the most accomplished independent hip hop albums of the year, one that deepens and stretches the tradition simultaneously.\n\n\n\nOriginally from the Washington D.C. area, Rob has been devoted to music since he was a kid, maintaining a deep connection to it in multiple forms (The Beatles, The Stones, Melle Mel, Run DMC, Kraftwerk, The Soul Sonic Force, The Talking Heads, Zeppelin, BDP, Public Enemy, Muddy Waters, UltraMangnetic MC's, The Clash, Devo, Goblin, David Bowie, EPMD). He developed his expressive abilities through grinding for 10 + years in New York City, living life in a way unique to the New York experience – hard fought, hard luck, high stress and no money tempered by huge dreams. In 2000, Rob gained critical acclaim as the front man of the group Sonic Sum, who's album The Sanity Annex won rave reviews in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with SPIN magazine voting it the \"2nd Best Album of the Year that No One Heard\". Kudos rolled in from publications such as The Source, The Wire, XXL, NME, Urb (Next 100), and CMJ. Word got around and soon came offers from artists like DJ Krush and Funkstorung to get down on their albums, a collaboration with Slug (Atmosphere) and Mike Ladd, plus shout outs from Radiohead, Bobbito Garcia, Autechre and others. Rob also happened to share the same management as Def Jux honcho El-P, and a friendship, as well as mutual artistic respect, formed. In 2003, Rob signed with the label, asking only for the opportunity to make a record with his heart, mind and soul, hence, Telicatessen. And it's all we could have ever asked for.\nDJ Zone\nLinks\nDJ ZONE has been touring relentlessley for the past decade, destroying turntables for Hip Hop artists \nincluding Sleep, The Chicharones, Aesop Rock, Grayskul, XPerience, Eddie Valiant, and Big Bang.\nHomeboy Sandman\nLinks\nHomeboy Sandman\nHomeboy Sandman is a musician. His genre is hip hop. An emcee that prides himself on musical growth and evolution, he has adopted as his motto and creative mission statement, \"Boy Sand like you've never seen him before. As usual.\"\n\nRaised in Queens, New York. Academic stints in New Hampshire, Philadelphia, London, and Long Island. One semester short on two different graduate degrees. A couple of years of New York City Public School teaching thrown in there in between. 9th and 10th grades. Some bartending too, at the legendary Lennox Lounge in Harlem. That's where Shaft used to drink.\n\nDecember 2006 he decides to cut all that miscellaneous nonsense and follow his passion. 7 releases deep and counting. Before signing to Stones Throw he'd already been chosen as a coach on MTV's MADE, prominently featured in preeminent print hip hop rags XXL and The Source, and perpetually championed on foremost online hubs like Okayplayer and 2DopeBoyz. Since inking with the label his accolades have extended beyond the realm of the hip hop specific. Rolling Stone has noted his \"skill for wordplay that keeps you hooked.\" NPR has highlighted his \"artful, hysterical, disobedient hip-hop that you can dance to.\" Pitchfork has straightforwardly dubbed him \"one of the best pure lyricists around.\"\n\nHe writes regularly for The Huffington Post too. Done some stuff for Gawker. While most of his writing is music it appears he'll write wherever a lot of people are looking. If he had an opportunity to give a speech at a huge rally he'd take that too, so more than anything else he just wants to spread the word. Maybe he just wants attention. Attention for being himself though. He'd never get into acting or anything like that.\n\nAnyway can't nobody rhyme like him.","artists":[{"id":1240,"name":"Aesop

Minneapolis show planned, he took to Twitter to let Minnesota fans know that would soon change. He had good reason to make it a priority: He's worked with local rappers going back to the turn of the millennium, and he's released his past two solo albums on Minneapolis label Rhymesayers. Now two full decades into the rap game, Aes is having some of his best musical years ever. In fact, he's getting better and better reviews, even from 20-something critics who grew up on Southern rap. First emerging as an integral piece of the Def Jux roster, he's continued to hone what he started: a grimy, sometimes psychedelic style of alt-rap fueled by a dazzling vocabulary. His work from the past year includes his Lice EP with Queens rapper Homeboy Sandman, which led to Run the Jewels comparisons, and his entirely self-produced solo LP, April's more personal The Impossible Kid. Opening are Rob Sonic, DJ Zone, Homeboy Sandman, and deM atlaS.                    \n        \n                \n            Promotional Event Description\n            Aesop Rock, Rob Sonic, and DJ Zone at First Avenue in the Mainroom\n            Aesop Rock,  Rob Sonic, and DJ Zone with Homeboy Sandman and deM atlaS   Monday, July 18 | 7:30PM | $20 | 18+  First Avenue in the Mainroom  Click HERE for more information.   Aesop Rock has started skateboarding again. Nearly every day, he hits up the skate park, working to get his skills back up. Skating and drawing (which he’s been doing more of, too) were his big passions before his hobby of making rap songs turned into a paying gig that turned into an accidental, 20-year long career, taking him from making beats in his bedroom to playing for crowds thousands deep. Going back to them just shy of 40-years old isn’t some kind of regressive midlife crisis move, though.","artists":[{"id":1240,"name":"Aesop

Nearly every day, he hits up the skate park, working to get his skills back up.Skating and drawing (which he&#8217;s been doing more of, too) were his big passions before his hobby of making rap songs turned into a paying gig that turned into an accidental, 20-year long career, taking him from making beats in his bedroom to playing for crowds thousands deep. Going back to them just shy of 40-years old isn&#8217;t some kind of regressive midlife crisis move, though. It&#8217;s more like a way to help process everything that&#8217;s happened in his life over the past couple decades, and maybe to figure out the person he&#8217;s become. That&#8217;s also what he&#8217;s trying to do with his seventh solo album, The Impossible Kid.Rap&#8217;s supposed to be a young man&#8217;s game, but Aesop&#8217;s only been improving as he&#8217;s gotten closer to middle age. He&#8217;s tackling different subject matter, going deep on topics like depression, his sometimes rocky relationships with his family, and the turbulent handful of years that culminated in Aesop leaving his adopted home of San Francisco to live in a barn out in the woods, where he recorded the foundations of The Impossible Kid.Those years have been productive, though. Since his last solo album, 2012&#8217;s Skelethon, Aesop has released collaborative albums with Kimya Dawson (The Uncluded&#8217;s Hokey Fright in 2013), with Rob Sonic (Hail Mary Mallon&#8217;s Bestiary in 2014, which was tracked in the same barn in the woods), and with Homeboy Sandman (LICE&#8217;s self-titled EP in 2015). He&#8217;s also been actively crafting beats. Recent projects include producing the 32+ minute instrumental mix, The Blob, working together with Nike to provide the music for a series of their skateboarding videos, and producing the soundtrack for the upcoming film Bushwick, starring Dave Bautista and Brittany Snow.Now comes The Impossible Kid, which finds Aesop still finding new ways to improve on the skills that have made him one of the kings of indie hip-hop. Part of the new creative process he brought to it includes a willingness to embrace the funny side that he kept quiet, when being taken as a serious lyricist was more of a priority. Combined with another newfound willingness to open up about his personal life, the bits of humor spiked throughout the album create a potent emotional cocktail. &#8220;Lotta Years&#8221; uses two short vignettes to meditate on outgrowing your corner of the culture while chuckling admiringly over the audacity of youth. &#8220;Blood Sandwich&#8221; recalls a couple of very weird scenes from his childhood starring his two brothers, told with the same combination of surreal comedy and genuine tenderness as a George Saunders story.At the same time, this is the most purely Aesop Rock record of his career. Like Skelethon, Aesop exercised complete creative control over the whole thing, from the production (which he handled himself, with instrumental help from Philly&#8217;s Grimace Foundation) to conceptualizing the cover art by his friend Alex Pardee.As you might have guessed, The Impossible Kid is a reference to Aesop himself, a person who&#8217;s spent his life doing things that seemed unthinkable before he just went and did them, blazing a visionary trail all his own. Two decades in, he&#8217;s still out there pushing it forward.","artists":[{"id":1240,"name":"Aesop
