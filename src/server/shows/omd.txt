bands hebben zo’n ellenlange lijst aan legendarische hits bij elkaar gepend als de Britten van Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. OMD ontstond in 1978 en had met eerste single Electricity (op het legendarische Factory-label, zie ook Joy Division, New Order en Happy Mondays) meteen een tijdloze culthit te pakken. Na debuutplaat OMD (1980) volgde snel het tweede album Organisation met doorbraakhit Enola Gay. Enola Gay brak in heel Europa door tot de top van de hitparades, maar OMD bevestigde pas echt hun legendarische status toen in 1981 Architecture & Morality uitkwam. De eerste twee singles van A&M kenden maar matig succes, maar toen in februari ’82 derde single Maid Of Orleans uitkwam katapulteerde die single OMD wereldwijd naar het hoogste schavot. Sinds 2006 toert OMD terug in de originele bezetting. Hun concerten zijn een combinatie van hun tijdloze hits én nieuw materiaal dat niet voor de grootste klassiekers moet onderdoen.\"The Punishment of Luxury\" is de 13de studioplaat van OMD en belooft een egwaagde verzameling van stijlvolle synthpop en meesterlijk songwriterschap te worden. De plaat werd volledig ingespeeld, opgenomen en gemixt door OMD zelf en laat een band horen op het toppunt van haar kunnen. OMD  is een band wiens DNA duidelijk aanwezig is in hedendaagse bands als The XX, Future Islands, CHVRCHES en LCD Soundsystem en op deze nieuwe plaat combineren ze hun volledig eigen sound feilloos met die van het heden en de toekomst. Dat belooft!","artists":[{"id":14223880,"name":"OMD","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/OMD/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":2758,"url":"OMD","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"De

Mise en vente le 29/09/17 à 12h Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) est le groupe pionnier de la synth-pop, fondé il y a presque 40 ans par Andy McCluskey et Paul Humphrey, dont les albums ‘Architecture and Morality’ (1981) et ‘Dazzle Ships’ (1983) ont façonné la dominante musicale de cette décennie. Aux côtés de The Human Leage et Gary Numan, OMD a défini le paysage musical et a aidé à installer le genre synth-pop avec des hits comme ‘Enola Gay’, ‘Electricity’ et ‘Souvenir’. Décrit par The Quietus comme « pas seulement l’un des meilleurs groupes de synth qui n’ai jamais existé – c’est l’un des meilleurs groupes de tous les temps. », l’influence d’OMD est omniprésente dans le genre. The XX, The Killers et James Muphy de LCD Soundsystem citent OMD comme source d’inspiration tandis que les shows de Future Islands et Chvrches suivent les traces de l’ADN d’OMD. Aujourd’hui, ils reviennent avec leur treizième album ‘The Punishment of Luxury’ : une collection de pop-synth stylée et de chansons magistrales par laquelle les OMD sortent de leur zone de confort sans compromettre leur intégrité. « C’est presque comme si nous étions de retour à l’adolescence après toutes ces années » dit Andy. « Nous faisons ce que nous voulons et il n’y a pas de label pour nous dire ce que nous devons faire ou pas. » C’est dans l’esprit de l’aventure et de la découverte que “Punishment…’ a été forgé. OMD ayant fait un album vintage avec « English Electric », leur meilleur depuis « Dazzle Ships », Andy et Paul ont pensé qu’ils pouvaient prendre plus de risques en studio et voir où les logiciels et les bases de données synthétiques sans limites allaient les mener. Leur vision de l’utopie ne s’est jamais vraiment matérialisée, bien sûr, mais avec « the Punishment of Luxury », OMD continue d’enrichir nos vies.","artists":[{"id":14223880,"name":"OMD","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/OMD/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":2758,"url":"OMD","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Le
