years ago Casino Royale was hitting the movie screens, Paul McCartney and Heather Mills split up and Zinedine Zidane was headbutting Marco Materazzi in the World Cup Final. It was also the year that ElectronicSessions first came onto the scene in London.\n\nSince their first event, Electronic Sessions have gone on to host events in the biggest clubs in London and have firmly established as one of the top club events in the city!\n\nElectronicSessions hits its 10 year birthday old in April, and to celebrate we're inviting them to do what they do best - party! Come and celebrate a decade of dancing and expect the birthday party to end all birthday parties.\n\nTo entertain you they've hand picked some of their all time favorite DJs,  some newer kids on the block and some well known back-to-back pairings. To make this a truly special ES Birthday, they have invited down none other than GUY J to grace the decks for a very special 5 HOUR SET - never seen before in London. Straddling the lively, timeless space between Ambient, House, Techno and Electronica, Guy J maintains a melodic and highly emotive core to his music.\n\nAugust Five has seen residencies at top London clubs Pacha London and The Qube Project as well as joining Holi One Festival for the UK Tour in 2014. In 2015 his official remix for none other than Fatboy Slim - 'Song For Shelter' (Skint Records) was approved by the man himself - a true feather in the cap for any artist. On top of this, releases on the well respected Hotfingers followed ('Stand By You'- #40 Beatport House Chart) as well as Grin Recordings, a label he works closely with/for.\n\nWe look forward to seeing all you clubbers and djs that have partied, and supported us through the decade of ES on what will be a very special night.\n\nAlso on the line-up:\n\nOlly Holmes\nJack Sumpter\nNik Lawson\nShaun Kay (Farewell set)\nTom Stainer\nJoe Atkinson\nTallent & Droschla\nDan Harrison\nRyan Pamatmat","artists":[{"id":207286,"name":"Guy

with GUY J (Lost & Found) at Audio \nPURCHASE YOUR TICKETS TODAY This show will sell out. \nTABLE RESERVATIONS: Text 415.305.7169 \nFRIDAY, JUNE 3RD \n21+ 10pm - 2am Audio, 316 11th Street \nABOUT GUY J: The true beauty of electronic music is that it has no limits. It exists to be molded into whatever the creator desires. Few embrace this luxury with more precision and care than Tel Aviv’s Guy J. Over the past decade Guy J’s seminal sounds of the moment have extended infinitely and will transcend beyond even his wildest expectations. With origins from the heart, Guy J’s sculptures of melody have developed a soul and a prolific life of their own. \nOn the path to becoming one of the premier artists of this electronic generation, Guy J has amassed a vast discography showcased within an eclectic list of world-renowned labels. His disregard for boundaries has catapulted his genre-diverse Lost & Found imprint into one of the most highly regarded brands in the underground. And Guy J live and studio mixes are beloved by house, trance and techno enthusiasts en masse. \nInspired by a simple desire to be a part of Tel Aviv’s flourishing club scene, famous for it’s wild enthusiasm and uninhibited atmosphere, Guy launched his music-writing career at the early age of 14. Voluntarily confined to his home studio—aptly named “The Cave” — Guy worked tirelessly to develop his skill set and still approaches each production as if it were his first. \nNaturally Guy's early influences were rooted in his homeland and the worlds of psy-trance and progressive. But it wasn’t long before he embraced all genres to establish the wide-ranging production style that represents the array of emotions fuelling his creativity. “I need every track to be real and honest to my feelings,” Guy professes. “I produce all kinds of house music so I have original material to play in clubs. My music is influenced by trance elements, but I love the warm vibe of progressive and energy of old school techno.” \nLost & Found is certainly the crown jewel of Guy’s portfolio. The label celebrates diversity and showcases the brilliance of veteran artists such as Kevin Yost, Funk D’Void and Eelke Kleijn, as well as emerging talent the likes of Guy Mantzur, Sahar Z and Brian Cid. Guy encourages submissions that remain unconditionally true to the artist and the result is a catalogue best described as “good electronic music” — in its purest form. \n From a dance floor perspective, Guy's unearthly DJ mixes have helped propel his prominence globally. His Balance Presents Guy J compilation for Australia’s illustrious Balance Music series is a perfect example of what to expect when Guy is in the booth. It’s a hypnotic trek through the entire spectrum of house music, composed with an assortment of originals, remixes and edits for an exquisite experience. Guy has the freedom to melt together melodies from all genres thanks to his production prowess and masterful touch with Ableton's revolutionary software. There are few as proficient in the art of progressive DJing as Guy J. \nOpening major events for John Digweed. Spinning back-to-back with all-time great, Hernan Cattaneo. Headlining gigs around the globe, most notably in the house music oasis of Argentina, where Guy has reached a level he thought he could only dream of. His list of ultra-impressive accolades is extensive and continually growing, yet Guy J remains his emotional and modest self. It's impossible to find even the slightest bit of pretentiousness in either Guy's personal or professional approach. \nHis innate sensitivity and strong belief in what you put into this world, you will receive from it; bind Guy to uncompromising honesty in his relationships, and of course, his music. He maintains his accessibility to peers and fans. He’s committed to the constant evolution of electronic music and cherishes his place within its history. It's tempting to close the circle and assume the role that comes with the status he’s achieved, but that's just not Guy J. He thrives like the stunning sounds he provides, with grace and without limits.","artists":[{"id":207286,"name":"Guy J","mbid":"bfaa69de-b75c-410a-8a23-c1accc0b5107","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5994615.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5994615.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GuyJ/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":29433,"url":"GuyJ","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Audio Nightclub","place":"Audio Nightclub","city":"San Francisco","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":37.7713623,"longitude":-122.4137955},"ontour_id":"Hh7QN97iQCWLQRnAA","genres":["minimal techno","progressive house","tech house"]},{"id":11670660,"artist_id":207286,"artist_event_id":14522673,"title":"Guy J @ Flash in Washington Dc, DC","datetime":"2016-06-09T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, June 9, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Washington Dc, DC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-03-15T15:49:13","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11670660?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Guy+J&came_from=67","description":"3-Year Anniversary: Motel Flash w/ Guy J","artists":[{"id":207286,"name":"Guy J","mbid":"bfaa69de-b75c-410a-8a23-c1accc0b5107","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5994615.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5994615.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GuyJ/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":29433,"url":"GuyJ","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Flash","place":"Flash","city":"Washington Dc","region":"DC","country":"United States","latitude":38.910198,"longitude":-77.017899},"ontour_id":"Hh7QN97iQCWLQRnAA","genres":["minimal techno","progressive house","tech house"]},{"id":11968212,"artist_id":207286,"artist_event_id":14929428,"title":"Guy J @ Sound-Bar in Chicago, IL","datetime":"2016-06-10T22:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, June 10, 2016 at 10:00PM","formatted_location":"Chicago, IL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11968212?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Guy+J&came_from=67","description":"Release Fridays at Soundbar!

with GUY J (Lost & Found) \"Starting at 11pm\" at Halcyon.Opening Set by Darren Grayson + Leyl Master Black + Zita Molnar\nPURCHASE TICKETS:Tickets starting at $10\nTABLE RESERVATIONS:Text 415-996-9822\nSUNDAY, JANUARY 15TH\n21+ 10pm - 4amHalcyon, 314 11th Street\nGUY J BIOGRAPHY:The true beauty of electronic music is that it has no limits. It exists to be molded into whatever the creator desires. Few embrace this luxury with more precision and care than Tel Aviv’s Guy J. Over the past decade Guy J’s seminal sounds of the moment have extended infinitely and will transcend beyond even his wildest expectations. With origins from the heart, Guy J’s sculptures of melody have developed a soul and a prolific life of their own.\nOn the path to becoming one of the premier artists of this electronic generation, Guy J has amassed a vast discography showcased within an eclectic list of world-renowned labels. His disregard for boundaries has catapulted his genre-diverse Lost & Found imprint into one of the most highly regarded brands in the underground. And Guy J live and studio mixes are beloved by house, trance and techno enthusiasts en masse.\nInspired by a simple desire to be a part of Tel Aviv’s flourishing club scene, famous for it’s wild enthusiasm and uninhibited atmosphere, Guy launched his music-writing career at the early age of 14. Voluntarily confined to his home studio—aptly named “The Cave” — Guy worked tirelessly to develop his skill set and still approaches each production as if it were his first.\nNaturally Guy's early influences were rooted in his homeland and the worlds of psy-trance and progressive. But it wasn’t long before he embraced all genres to establish the wide-ranging production style that represents the array of emotions fuelling his creativity. “I need every track to be real and honest to my feelings,” Guy professes. “I produce all kinds of house music so I have original material to play in clubs. My music is influenced by trance elements, but I love the warm vibe of progressive and energy of old school techno.”\nLost & Found is certainly the crown jewel of Guy’s portfolio. The label celebrates diversity and showcases the brilliance of veteran artists such as Kevin Yost, Funk D’Void and Eelke Kleijn, as well as emerging talent the likes of Guy Mantzur, Sahar Z and Brian Cid. Guy encourages submissions that remain unconditionally true to the artist and the result is a catalogue best described as “good electronic music” — in its purest form.\nFrom a dance floor perspective, Guy's unearthly DJ mixes have helped propel his prominence globally. His Balance Presents Guy J compilation for Australia’s illustrious Balance Music series is a perfect example of what to expect when Guy is in the booth. It’s a hypnotic trek through the entire spectrum of house music, composed with an assortment of originals, remixes and edits for an exquisite experience. Guy has the freedom to melt together melodies from all genres thanks to his production prowess and masterful touch with Ableton's revolutionary software. There are few as proficient in the art of progressive DJing as Guy J.\nOpening major events for John Digweed. Spinning back-to-back with all-time great, Hernan Cattaneo. Headlining gigs around the globe, most notably in the house music oasis of Argentina, where Guy has reached a level he thought he could only dream of. His list of ultra-impressive accolades is extensive and continually growing, yet Guy J remains his emotional and modest self. It's impossible to find even the slightest bit of pretentiousness in either Guy's personal or professional approach.\nHis innate sensitivity and strong belief in what you put into this world, you will receive from it; bind Guy to uncompromising honesty in his relationships, and of course, his music. He maintains his accessibility to peers and fans. He’s committed to the constant evolution of electronic music and cherishes his place within its history. It's tempting to close the circle and assume the role that comes with the status he’s achieved, but that's just not Guy J. He thrives like the stunning sounds he provides, with grace and without limits.","artists":[{"id":207286,"name":"Guy

us for the momentous Kickoff of Denver's new monthly industry and local Thursday night Blast:\nTHURSDAY NIGHT SERVICE: 06:01:17\nDelivering Mass through musical heresy for the evening's congregation:\nMystic Rabbi - GUY J (Lost and Found, Isreal)\nArch Bishop - Mental 69 (Fantastic Hosts)\nAlter Duties - DSQISE\n21+ ONLY\n\n\nThe true beauty of electronic music is that it has no limits. It exists to be molded into whatever the creator desires. Few embrace this luxury with more precision and care than Tel Aviv’s Guy J. Over the past decade Guy J’s seminal sounds of the moment have extended infinitely and will transcend beyond even his wildest expectations. With origins from the heart, Guy J’s sculptures of melody have developed a soul and a prolific life of their own. \n\nOn the path to becoming one of the premier artists of this electronic generation, Guy J has amassed a vast discography showcased within an eclectic list of world-renowned labels. His disregard for boundaries has catapulted his genre-diverse Lost & Found imprint into one of the most highly regarded brands in the underground.  And Guy J live and studio mixes are beloved by house, trance and techno enthusiasts en masse.\n\nInspired by a simple desire to be a part of Tel Aviv’s flourishing club scene, famous for it’s wild enthusiasm and uninhibited atmosphere, Guy launched his music-writing career at the early age of 14.  Voluntarily confined to his home studio—aptly named “The Cave” — Guy worked tirelessly to develop his skill set and still approaches each production as if it were his first. \n\nNaturally, Guy's early influences were rooted in his homeland and the worlds of psytrance and progressive. But it wasn’t long before he embraced all genres to establish the wide-ranging production style that represents the array of emotions fuelling his creativity. “I need every track to be real and honest to my feelings,” Guy professes. “I produce all kinds of house music so I have original material to play in clubs.  My music is influenced by trance elements, but I love the warm vibe of progressive and energy of old school techno.”\n\nLost & Found is certainly the crown jewel of Guy’s portfolio. The label celebrates diversity and showcases the brilliance of veteran artists such as Kevin Yost, Funk D’Void, and Eelke Kleijn, as well as emerging talent the likes of Guy Mantzur, Sahar Z and Brian Cid. Guy encourages submissions that remain unconditionally true to the artist and the result is a catalog best described as “good electronic music” — in its purest form.  \n\n\nFrom a dance floor perspective, Guy's unearthly DJ mixes have helped propel his prominence globally.  His Balance Presents Guy J compilation for Australia’s illustrious Balance Music series is a perfect example of what to expect when Guy is in the booth.   It’s a hypnotic trek through the entire spectrum of house music, composed with an assortment of originals, remixes, and edits for an exquisite experience.  Guy has the freedom to melt together melodies from all genres thanks to his production prowess and a masterful touch with Ableton's revolutionary software.  There are few as proficient in the art of progressive DJing as Guy J. \n\nOpening major events for John Digweed. Spinning back-to-back with all-time great, Hernan Cattaneo.  Headlining gigs around the globe, most notably in the house music oasis of Argentina, where Guy has reached a level he thought he could only dream of.  His list of ultra-impressive accolades is extensive and continually growing, yet Guy J remains his emotional and modest self. It's impossible to find even the slightest bit of pretentiousness in either Guy's personal or professional approach.\n\nHis innate sensitivity and a strong belief in what you put into this world, you will receive from it; bind Guy to uncompromising honesty in his relationships, and of course, his music. He maintains his accessibility to peers and fans.  He’s committed to the constant evolution of electronic music and cherishes his place within its history.  It's tempting to close the circle and assume the role that comes with the status he’s achieved, but that's just not Guy J.  He thrives like the stunning sounds he provides, with grace and without limits.   \nFor everything Guy J visit www.guy-j.com and www.guyjstore.com.

Mas como a mágica sempre tem lá seus mistérios, o melhor é deixar as explicações de lado e simplesmente aproveitar. \r\n\r\nUma noite no Warung nunca é igual à outra. Por isso, todas são especiais.
