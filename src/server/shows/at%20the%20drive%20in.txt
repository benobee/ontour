the Drive-In is an American punk rock band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 1993. The band currently consists of Cedric Bixler (vocals), Omar RodrÃ­guez (guitar, vocals), Paul Hinojos (bass), Tony Hajjar (drums) and Keeley Davis (guitar, vocals).After several early line-up changes, the band solidified into a five-piece, consisting of Bixler, RodrÃ­guez, Jim Ward, Hinojos and Hajjar. At the Drive-In released three studio albums and five EPs before breaking up in 2001. Their final album, 2000`s Relationship of Command, received a number of accolades and is cited as a landmark of the post-hardcore genre. Following the breakup, Bixler-Zavala and RodrÃ­guez-LÃ³pez formed The Mars Volta while Ward, Hinojos, and Hajjar formed Sparta. At the Drive-In reunited in January 2012 and played the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, as well as the 2012 Lollapalooza Festival.In 2016, the band reunited for a second time, with guitarist and occasional lead vocalist Jim Ward no longer participating. He was replaced by Sparta`s Keeley Davis.","artists":[{"id":11138604,"name":"At The Drive
