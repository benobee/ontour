It started back in 2013 when the talented twosome released their immediately singular and standout debut single ‘Another Way’ on Freeze Dried. That single soon found its way intothe charts and eventually hit the top spot. It lead to the Detroiters behind it being booked to play all manner of high profile DJ gigs around the world, including at esteemed festivals and clubs such as Output in New York, Verboten, Flash, Bar Standard, Movement in Detroit and Electric Forest. The duo were also invited on world renowned video streaming platform Boiler Room and played live when the crew visited Detroit.  Support by Shadow People [Soul Fuel Recordings] MKE aka Jonn Hawley and J.c. Hanna https://www.facebook.com/shadowpeopleMKE https://soundcloud.com/jonn-hawley https://soundcloud.com/jchanna  Shadow People is a forward thinking house and techno production and dj duo hailing from Milwaukee, WI. Their sets are completely improv, live/hybrid, 4 deck 2 mixer 4x4 madness.  The Shadow People project came together in 2009 as a result of a partnership between Jonn Hawley and JC Hanna. Drawn together by a shared passion for moving crowds keeping quality at the forefront of electronic music, they decided to begin working on projects at Hawley’s Foundation 75 Studios. With Jonn’s technical ability in the studio along with JC’s DJ sensibility and love for darker rhythms, the Shadow People project has truly taken on a life of it’s own. After the release of their first few projects on labels such as Smoke City (NYC/Huddersfield), Lingo Recordings (Cincinnati), as well as their own Soul Fuel imprint, they've decided to take their act on the road. With a combined 35 years of experience behind the decks, this duo blurs the lines between house and techno through a combination of live elements as well as a seamless blending on a 4 deck setup. These two are on a mission to help put the vibe back into the scene that is deeply rooted in the past as well as focused on the sounds of the future. \n \nStrict Dress Code Rules Apply : No Gym Shoes, No Hats, No Sports Attire, No Graphic Tees, No Shorts - Collared Shirts & Dress Shoes Recommended!  \nEarly arrival is strongly suggested!

producers; club headliners; after-party enthusiasts: Golf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focussed creativity. And with releases on some of the world’s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they’re only just getting started.\nWith roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.\nReleases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint and Kerri Chandler’s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it’s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. Regulars at esteemed clubs like Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit, they have also performed at festivals Movement, Electric Forest, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.\nWhether they’re playing clubs, warehouse shows or at an impromptu after-party – which they more than likely arranged themselves – the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San or any of the other DJs who’ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.\nAs with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap’s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you’ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.\n2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions ‘All You Need’ and ‘Feel It’ on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes ‘Deeper Love’. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour in May and upcoming bookings at Mysteryland and Spring Awakening this summer, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.\n\n\n\n\nCALL 415 300 2995, FOR TABLE RESERVATIONS","artists":[{"id":369995,"name":"Golf

And with releases on some of the world&#8217;s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they&#8217;re only just getting started.&nbsp;With roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.&nbsp;Releases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler&#8217;s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it&#8217;s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.&nbsp;Whether they&#8217;re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party &#8211; which they more than likely arranged themselves &#8211; the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San or any of the other DJs who&#8217;ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.&nbsp;As with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap&#8217;s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you&#8217;ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.&nbsp;2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions &#8216;All You Need&#8217; and &#8216;Feel It&#8217; on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes &#8216;Deeper Love&#8217;. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOCAL SUPPORT FROM:SubsetDurum21+&#8212;-NOISE COMPLAINT&nbsp;As Electronic Dance Music has exploded in popularity over the last several years, so have clubs, festivals, ticket prices, and egos along with it. In the beginning, dance music related events were held in underground, often intimate venues. It was about the music, and it was about each other.&nbsp;Gone are those days, seemingly. With every club and festival being so overcrowded and oversold, one begins to ask if it is even about the music anymore. We want to bring it back to its roots. We want to bring in top quality talent, at a small price in an intimate space. We want it to be about the music and we want it to be about you.&nbsp;Noise Complaint is more than &quot;another show&quot;. It is a party for the people, by the people. An event where the music is the centerpiece - and a small, intimate venue creates a vibe that rises above all.&nbsp;Join us on this journey, become part of our family, and help us create an experience that seems far too gone any more. You can find us at Kremwerk in Seattle where we&#39;ll be dancing to a wide range of some of the finest house and techno on the planet.Noise Complaint - WE HEAR YOU.","artists":[{"id":369995,"name":"Golf Clap","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8060608.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8060608.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GolfClap/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Golf%20Clap/517103288329217","tracker_count":8137,"url":"GolfClap","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Kremwerk","place":"Kremwerk","city":"Seattle","region":"WA","country":"United States","latitude":47.616869,"longitude":-122.331184},"ontour_id":"ASJzm56Gdh5jDun2M","genres":[]},{"id":12339076,"artist_id":369995,"artist_event_id":16006482,"title":"Golf Clap @ Coda in Philadelphia, PA","datetime":"2016-10-21T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, October 21, 2016 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Philadelphia, PA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-06-24T10:00:01","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12339076?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Golf+Clap&came_from=67","description":"Justin Martin + Golf Clap","artists":[{"id":369995,"name":"Golf Clap","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8060608.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8060608.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GolfClap/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Golf%20Clap/517103288329217","tracker_count":8137,"url":"GolfClap","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Coda","place":"Coda","city":"Philadelphia","region":"PA","country":"United States","latitude":39.9497186,"longitude":-75.1698503},"ontour_id":"ASJzm56Gdh5jDun2M","genres":[]},{"id":13082590,"artist_id":369995,"artist_event_id":16434714,"title":"Golf Clap @ Flash Factory in New York, NY","datetime":"2016-10-22T23:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 22, 2016 at 11:00PM","formatted_location":"New York, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-09-09T13:23:31","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13082590?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Golf+Clap&came_from=67","description":"Shiba San, Golf Clap","artists":[{"id":369995,"name":"Golf Clap","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8060608.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8060608.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GolfClap/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Golf%20Clap/517103288329217","tracker_count":8137,"url":"GolfClap","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Flash Factory","place":"Flash Factory","city":"New York","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.748055,"longitude":-73.994748},"ontour_id":"ASJzm56Gdh5jDun2M","genres":[]},{"id":12980698,"artist_id":369995,"artist_event_id":16298410,"title":"Golf Clap @ Soundcheck in Washington, DC","datetime":"2016-11-02T22:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, November 2, 2016 at 10:00PM","formatted_location":"Washington, DC","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-09-22T14:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12980698?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Golf+Clap&came_from=67","description":"BLURRRED feat.
