He hand-dyes silk with subtle colors made only from natural materials following a process that is over 2,000 years old. He also creates a wide range of functional and colorful modern garments with traditional weaving and knitting techniques. Many of his works and couture outfits have been exhibited in New York, Vienna, and Copenhagen.\n\nFor his Maui exhibition, Izukura has created a large installation made of woven silk, in a large ovoid form supported by bamboo, that visitors are invited to walk through. This tunnel-like structure, resembling a giant silk worm cocoon, presents a calm connection to being inside nature and experiencing the life of the creature transformed into a breathable silk textile.\n\nSEE PHOTOS  ( exhibit & opening receptions )\n\n“Within the handwoven tunnel created by circular movement, I have arranged two pieces: a sphere with a diameter of two meters which was spun by ten thousand silkworms as they rotated their heads, and another sphere which I made out of cocoons. These are products of nature that I learned about from silkworms. In Hawai‘i, everything in nature is blessed by the gifts of sun and rainwater, so I was inspired to create the technique I call, taiyōzome, literally ‘sun dyeing’ -  a dye method that replaces manmade fire with the power of sunlight alone. What a beautiful fairness there is in nature!” says Akihiko Izukura.\n\nThe symbiotic relation between man and nature has become the philosophy and focus behind Izukura's work. Along with the installation will be educational information about his processes and a small collection of his couture made with techniques in weaving, netting, braiding, and entwining silk. \n\nTo enhance the ambience of the space, MACC has commissioned San Francisco-based composer, Christopher Willits, to create an ambient sound collage for this exhibition for an overall feeling of transformation. Live performance will take place on Saturday, March 4 during \"Observe & Play Family Day,\" 10 am - 12 noon.","artists":[{"id":81988,"name":"Christopher Willits","mbid":"035bec02-b404-4f1a-9e2a-9c0ab591d89e","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8037291.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8037291.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ChristopherWillits/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/christopher.willits.page","tracker_count":8718,"url":"ChristopherWillits","website":"http://www.christopherwillits.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Maui Arts and Cultural Center","place":"Maui Arts and Cultural Center","city":"Kahului","region":"HI","country":"United States","latitude":20.892731,"longitude":-156.480363},"ontour_id":"E29Ta9Nk6SHWnCHpv","genres":["ambient","drone","electronica","glitch","j-ambient","warm drone"]},{"id":13658111,"artist_id":81988,"artist_event_id":17539482,"title":"Christopher Willits @ The Midway in San Francisco, CA","datetime":"2017-03-18T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, March 18, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"San Francisco, CA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-01-11T13:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13658111?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Christopher+Willits&came_from=67","description":"Future Fires & The Midway Present:\n\nLuminary: Art, Tech, Music\nFeaturing: SHIGETO\n\nLuminary, a first-of-its-kind Bay Area event premieres on March 18, 2017 at The Midway, offering a unique and immersive live experience.
