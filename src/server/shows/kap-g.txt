One overlooked struggle in music is that of the Mexican-American. Now that the art form is experiencing the greatest global exposure in its history, the door is wide open for a new story to be told and embraced. Twenty year-old Kap G hopes to be the primary author of this story.   Kap was initially discovered by Grammy award winning Executive Kawan Prather who then signed him to Pharrell's i am other imprint. Kap G first came on the scene via his viral single \"Tatted Like Amigos\" feat Chief Keef in 2013 which reached well over 1M+ views just weeks after being released.  Following in the footsteps of his El Southside mixtape from last year, which spawned his huge hit “Girlfriend,” the Georgia native is giving us 12 new tracks, which contain features from Pharrell, Chris Brown, Dae Dae, and Kapfe.\r\n\r\nKAP-G - Girlfriend\r\nPlays: 786,240\r\n\r\n\r\nTickets: After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.
