isn’t an easy band to pigeonhole—and they wouldn’t have it any other way. In fact, the Los Angeles-formed duo of vocalist/guitarist Ben Jaffe and vocalist/banjoist/violinist Suzanne Santo has the uncanny ability to shapeshift between genres and moods. With Santo’s Bonnie Raitt-esque croon as an anchor, their music touches on dusty blues, world-weary folk, jaunty Americana, barnstorming roots-rock and romantic country.","artists":[{"id":244378,"name":"HONEYHONEY","mbid":"449b43e3-2891-4a49-a150-3f22ea934eec","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8083202.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8083202.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HONEYHONEY/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/honeyhoneyband","tracker_count":31680,"url":"HONEYHONEY","website":"http://honeyhoneyband.com"},{"id":157356,"name":"Chris

duo of honeyhoney, consisting of Suzanne Santo and Ben Jaffe, is one of those acts that, in recent years, have found themselves just on the cusp of breakthrough stardom. They made some noise in 2008 when their jaunty, edgy single \"Little Toy Gun\" found its way into the mainstream, if only for a bit. Furthermore, the album that featured \"Little Toy Gun,\" First Rodeo, garnered a bit of attention due to the man who owned the label that released it: Keifer Sutherland. Like many of the better acts going these days, it's hard to pin-down where their sound belongs in the sonic spectrum.

Through Productions presents an outstanding evening of county influenced Americana with HoneyHoney live on the Temblor Brewing Company stage, Friday night, October 28th at 7PM.  HoneyHoney is Ben Jaffe and Suzanne Santo and together they’ve been making music for more than a decade, recording as well as opening shows around the world for acts such as Sheryl Crow. With Santo’s strong lead vocals, banjo, and violin melding together with Jaffe’s soft harmonies and lead guitars, they’ve garnered positive press and a loyal following. Their 2015 Rounder Records release simply titled 3 (it’s the third studio album for HoneyHoney) continues to receive critical acclaim.  Also appearing: Herbie Benham. It’ll be a great night of music in one of Bakersfield’s most relaxed and enjoyable concert venues.  We look forward to seeing you there!","artists":[{"id":244378,"name":"HONEYHONEY","mbid":"449b43e3-2891-4a49-a150-3f22ea934eec","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8083202.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8083202.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/HONEYHONEY/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/honeyhoneyband","tracker_count":31680,"url":"HONEYHONEY","website":"http://honeyhoneyband.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Temblor Brewing Company","place":"Temblor Brewing Company","city":"Bakersfield","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":35.3887749,"longitude":-119.0422211},"ontour_id":"sEPBZvzXHpM9uLPjP","genres":["alternative country","folk-pop","indie folk","new americana","progressive bluegrass","stomp and holler"]},{"id":13040636,"artist_id":244378,"artist_event_id":16435741,"title":"HONEYHONEY @ Herman's Hideaway in Denver, CO","datetime":"2016-11-12T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, November 12, 2016 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Denver, CO","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-10-06T12:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13040636?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=HONEYHONEY&came_from=67","description":"2016 Rock It Forward Benefit ~ feat.
