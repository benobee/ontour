Skivvies are Lauren Molina and Nick Cearley, award-winning NYC singer/actor/musicians performing stripped down arrangements of eclectic covers and eccentric originals. Not only is the music stripped down - cello, ukulele, glockenspiel, melodica - butthe Skivvies literally strip down to their underwear to perform. The Wall Street Journal calls them “smart, sophisticated…ingenious,” and Out Magazine says, “The Skivvies have managed to carve out a niche that we never knew needed to exist: part Weird Al- parody and part sexy burlesque…and unusual explosion of satire and sultry.”  People Magazine recently named The Skivvies “The Most Playful Performers” in The Most Talked about Bodies of 2014 issue.  The New York Times calls them “a hot musical comedy duo specializing in unexpected arrangements, incongruous mashups, and of course, highly toned displays of skin.”\n \nMolina (Broadway's Rock of Ages, Sweeney Todd, Mary Zimmerman's Candide - Helen Hayes Award, Marry Me A Little) and Cearley(Broadway First National All Shook Up, Pageant, and on the OUT 100 list as one of the ‘most compelling actors of 2014’) became YouTube sensations with their Skivvies covers of artists like Robyn, Carole King and Rihanna. The videos led to live shows, and now this “musically thrilling”, undie-rock, comedy-pop duo continues to perform to sold-out audiences in New York and beyond. Previous venues include their residency at 54 Below, 42 West, The Highline Ballroom, Roseland Ballroom, Joe's Pub, The Cutting Room, Rockwell Table &amp; Stage in Los Angeles, Williamstown Theatre Festival, Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, City Theatre in Pittsburgh, Bay Street Theatre, Philadelphia’s Kimmel Center, Key West’s Red Barn Theatre, and The Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, PA where they also starred as Brad and Janet in The Rocky Horror Show directed by Hunter Foster.\n \nThe Skivvies have performed at events such as Broadway Bares (raising money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS), A Tribute to Angela Lansbury with Tyne Daly and Christine Ebersole, Broadway for Obama, Human Rights Campaign benefit, Theatre C. They have made appearances on NBC, and filmed pilots for the FOX, A&amp;E, and WE.\n \nThey also have a single, Hardbody Hoedown and music video directed by AugustenBurroughs, bestselling author of Running With Scissors.\n\nWITH SPECIAL GUESTS:\n\nLaura Bell Bundy\nAnnaleigh Ashford\nNicole Parker\nJoseph Morales\nMary Faber\nAsmeret Ghebremichael\nJeremy Jordan\nHeath Calvert","artists":[{"id":3626004,"name":"The Skivvies","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheSkivvies/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":1302,"url":"TheSkivvies","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Rockwell","place":"Rockwell","city":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":34.1022214,"longitude":-118.2915456},"ontour_id":"cKfo2sXKC4hpaQhTx","genres":[]},{"id":13155714,"artist_id":3626004,"artist_event_id":16533098,"title":"The Skivvies @ Stateside at the Paramount in Austin, TX","datetime":"2016-11-04T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, November 4, 2016 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Austin, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13155714?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Skivvies&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":3626004,"name":"The Skivvies","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheSkivvies/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":1302,"url":"TheSkivvies","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Stateside at the Paramount","place":"Stateside at the Paramount","city":"Austin","region":"TX","country":"United States","latitude":30.269397,"longitude":-97.74191},"ontour_id":"cKfo2sXKC4hpaQhTx","genres":[]},{"id":12580806,"artist_id":3626004,"artist_event_id":15753094,"title":"The Skivvies @ Abdo New River Room at the Broward Center in Ft Lauderdale, FL","datetime":"2016-12-03T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Ft Lauderdale, FL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-08-19T14:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12580806?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Skivvies&came_from=67","description":"Straight from the basement of New Yorks Studio 54: The Skivvies!
