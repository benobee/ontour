Darin Gray, resemble ethnomusicologists on holiday. Their intoxicating 2009 album Extended Vacation simulated a tropical retreat with a neo-exotica assemblage of mallet instruments, squawking birds, and ambient electronics — the only thing missing was Sandra Warner, the model who graced so many Martin Denny album covers. On Fillmore's new Happiness of Living, recorded in Rio de Janeiro, is yet another type of trip. Paradoxically dense yet spacious, and chattering with Brazilian percussion, Happiness contains plenty of enchanting bucolic elements — including a cosmic mbira and a frequently employed wordless vocalist, Gabriela Riley, who pops up in tracks titled \"Cave Crickets\" and \"Espac?ao\" (Space) — alongside darker and more abrasive effects.","artists":[{"id":639542,"name":"On Fillmore","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/496814.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/496814.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/OnFillmore/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":486,"url":"OnFillmore","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"National Sawdust","place":"National Sawdust","city":"Brooklyn","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.718877,"longitude":-73.961362},"ontour_id":"GAqTgwnGyyaXbFPzz","genres":["deep german indie"]},{"id":14340337,"artist_id":639542,"artist_event_id":18216947,"title":"On Fillmore @ National Sawdust in Brooklyn, NY","datetime":"2017-04-09T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, April 9, 2017 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Brooklyn, NY","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14340337?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=On+Fillmore&came_from=67","description":"Doors at 6PM\nAdvance $29  |  At the Door $34\nEnjoy the concert AND the Solid Sound Film Screening after at 830PM\nCarved from an ecstatic multi-day session in Rio de Janeiro, On Fillmore’s newest album Happiness of Living moves effortlessly between deep cosmic pockets, celestial vocals and occasional pop tunes to create a glowing mood unlike anything previously released from the long-running musical partnership of percussionist Glenn Kotche (Wilco) and bassist Darin Gray (Tweedy). The Brazilian sessions that would become Happiness of Living unfolded in a spirit of openness with On Fillmore inviting others into their deepest creative space for the first time, including esteemed producer Kassin (Caetano Veloso, Arto Lindsay). Kotche and Gray can remember “the musically life-changing experience” of first seeing Kassin perform in Brazil at the 2005 Perc Pan Festival, prompting them to invite him and others back to Chicago for a collaborative show. That meeting opened the door for their critically-acclaimed 2009 album, Extended Vacation (Dead Oceans), which Pitchfork called “accessible but not pedestrian, complex but not esoteric”, and which now becomes fully formed in the 2017 release of Happiness of Living on Northern Spy Records.\nGlenn Kotche  |  Darin Gray\nDirected by Christoph Green and Brendan Canty, Every Other Summer is a documentary about the Solid Sound Festival, Wilco’s three day music and arts gathering that takes place once every two years at MASS MoCA. Shot at the most recent festival and featuring performances by Wilco, Neko Case, Yo La Tengo, The Dream Syndicate, Lucius, Foxygen, Sam Amidon, Sean Rowe, The Relatives and appearances from Reggie Watts, John Hodgman, Jen Kirkman and others, Every Other Summer offers a peek into the festival’s utopian vibe, and the positive transformative impact it has had on the small rust belt town of North Adams, MA.\nMore info...","artists":[{"id":639542,"name":"On Fillmore","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/496814.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/496814.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/OnFillmore/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":486,"url":"OnFillmore","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"National Sawdust","place":"National Sawdust","city":"Brooklyn","region":"NY","country":"United States","latitude":40.718877,"longitude":-73.961362},"ontour_id":"GAqTgwnGyyaXbFPzz","genres":["deep german indie"]}]
