Of Four performing live Friday October 16th at The New Parish in Oakland!\n\nTickets: http://thenewparish.com/event.cfm?id=216762&cart\n\nGang Of Four Official\n\nUK's legendary post-punk GANG OF FOUR will release a new album, \"What Happens Next,\" on February 24, 2015 on Metropolis Records in the USA and Canada, and Membran in Europe. The follow-up to the critically acclaimed album Content, \"What Happens Next\" features collaborations with Alison Mosshart from The Kills, Robbie Furze from The Big Pink, Gail Ann Dorsey, German superstar Herbert Grönemeyer and Japanese superstar Hotei. \n \nThe first album without vocalist Jon King, \"What Happens Next\" refers to both the outside world and the band itself: an emphatic commitment to the future. \"The focus is more on universal issues, like how individuals behave in certain ways or how our world is constructed, than local issues or current affairs,\" says founding guitarist and songwriter Andy Gill. \"Gang of Four is anything but parochial.\" When King left the project, a reinvigorated Gill seized the opportunity to re-imagine Gang of Four from the ground up. The new album is an unexpected twist that still operates as the next logical step for the legendary post-punk. \n \nSandwiched between Joy Division's landmark album \"Unknown Pleasures\" and Led Zepellin's iconic \"IV,\" Gang of Four's debut \"Entertainment!\" sits at #8 on Pitchfork's Top 100 of the 1970s, proclaiming it \"caustic and bursting with disgust for unethical capitalism, opportunist politicians and consumer society, among other things, but it's also crafted with amazing pop sensibility -- and is, of course, remarkably danceable.\" Earlier this year, that same album was found on Kurt Cobain's handwritten list of favorite albums. Echoing the singular importance of the band's impact on music, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello told Rolling Stone this past July 2014 that \"there's no one more influential on my guitar playing than Andy Gill.\" Having been named a massive influence by many artists including Bloc Party, R.E.M., The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, The Rapture, Franz Ferdinand and LCD Soundsystem, among hundreds of others, Gang of Four's legacy continues not by being frozen in a moment in time, but by constant evolution while remaining true to the original spirit of the band. \n \n\"What Happens Next\" was written and produced by Andy Gill in London. The lead single from \"What Happens Next\" is \"Broken Talk,\" which features vocals from Alison Mosshart. \n \nGang of Four is Andy Gill (guitar), John \"Gaoler\" Sterry (vocals), Thomas McNiece (bass) and Jonny Finnegan (drums).\n\nThe New Parish\n1743 San Pablo Ave. Oakland \n8pm  | 18+","artists":[{"id":3702,"name":"Gang of
