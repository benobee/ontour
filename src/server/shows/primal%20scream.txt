November 12\n\nThe Cult\nPrimal Scream\nON SALE 7/31 12:00PM\n7 p.m. doors, 8 p.m. show\nAll ages welcome\n$49.50 advance, $54.50 day of show\nThe Cult\nFollowing a succession of name and stylistic changes, the Cult emerged in 1984 as one of England's leading heavy metal revivalists. Picking up the pseudo-mysticism and Native American obsessions of the Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock, the Cult gained a dedicated following in their native Britain with mid-'80s singles like \"She Sells Sanctuary\" before breaking into the American metal market in the late '80s with \"Love Removal Machine.\" Though they managed one Top Ten in America with 1989's Sonic Temple, the Cult were plagued with off-stage tensions and problems that prevented them from retaining their popularity. The band split in 1995 following a pair of unsuccessful records, but returned on an occasional basis for new records -- always anchored by vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy.\n\nThe origins of the Cult lie in the Southern Death Cult, a goth rock outfit formed by vocalist Ian Astbury (born May 14, 1962) in 1981. Astbury was the son of a merchant navy man, which meant he moved frequently during his youth; at one point in his childhood, his family lived in Canada, where the young Astbury became fascinated with Native Americans, which would become a recurring theme in his songwriting. Astbury eventually settled in Bradford, Yorkshire, where he met a group comprised of David Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass), and Haq Quereshi (drums). Ian joined the group as its lead vocalist (performing with the last name of \"Lindsay,\" which was his mother's maiden name) and had the group renamed the Southern Death Cult. At only its fifth concert, the band was attracting audiences of 2,000. In December 1982, the Southern Death Cult released their first single -- the double A-side \"Moya\"/\"Fatman\" -- and the following month, they supported Bauhaus on tour. Though the group's future was looking bright, Astbury pulled the plug on the band because he was frustrated with the positive articles he was receiving in the press. The remaining three members joined Getting the Fear, which eventually became Into a Circle; in the late '80s, Quereshi became a member of Fun^Da^Mental. All of the Southern Death Cult recordings were eventually released in 1986.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of the Southern Death Cult, Astbury shortened the name of the group to Death Cult and recruited guitarist Billy Duffy -- who had previously played with Morrissey in the pre-Smiths band the Nosebleeds, as well as Theatre of Hate -- and drummer Ray Mondo and bassist Jamie Stewart, who had previously played with Ritual. Death Cult released an eponymous EP in the summer of 1983; on the EP, Astbury reverted back to his given name. Later in the year, Mondo was replaced by Nigel Preston, who had previously played with Duffy in Theatre of Hate; coincidentally, Mondo became the drummer for Preston's previous band, Sex Gang Children.\n\n\nIn early 1984, the bandmembers decided to excise \"Death\" from the title, fearing that the word gave them the misleading appearance of being a goth band. Where both Southern Death Cult and Death Cult had been overtly influenced by post-punk, the Cult were a heavy hard rock band with slight psychedelic flourishes. Dreamtime, the group's first album, was released in the fall of 1984, accompanied by the single \"Spiritwalker.\" Dreamtime reached number 21 on the U.K. charts. In the spring of 1985, Preston left the group. For the group's summer single, \"She Sells Sanctuary,\" the band was joined by Big Country's drummer, Mark Brzezicki. \"She Sells Sanctuary\" became a major U.K. hit, peaking at number 15. During the recording of the group's second album, drummer Les Warner joined the group. Love, released in the fall of 1985, continued the hard rock direction of its teaser single and became a number four hit in Britain.\n\n\nFor their third album, the Cult shuffled their lineup -- Stewart moved to rhythm guitar, while former Zodiac Mindwarp bassist Kid Chaos joined the lineup -- and hired Rick Rubin as producer, and the result, Electric, was their hardest, heaviest record to date. The first single from the album, \"Love Removal Machine,\" became a number 18 hit in the spring of 1987, while the album itself reached number four in the U.K. upon its April release. Later that year, Electric gained the Cult a fan base in America, and the album cracked the U.S. Top 40.\n\n\nIn 1988, the group fired Chaos and Warner, replacing the latter with Matt Sorum; the band failed to hire another bassist. The new lineup released Sonic Temple, which would prove to be the band's most successful album. The hit single \"Fire Woman\" helped propel the album into the American Top Ten, and within no time the Cult were seen hanging out with the likes of Mötley Crüe and Aerosmith, as well as supporting Metallica on the Damaged Justice tour. Though the group was experiencing its best sales, it was fraying behind the scenes, due to infighting and substance abuse. By the time they recorded their follow-up to Sonic Temple, Sorum had left to join Guns n' Roses and Stewart had quit; they were replaced by drummer Mickey Curry and bassist Charlie Drayton. The resulting album, Ceremony, was released in the fall of 1991 to weak reviews and disappointing sales.\n\n\nFollowing the release of Ceremony, the group took a break for the next three years. In 1993, the band released the U.K.-only hits compilation Pure Cult, which debuted at number one. By summer 1993, the Cult had a new rhythm section, featuring former Mission bassist Craig Adams and drummer Scott Garrett. This lineup recorded The Cult, which was released in late 1994 to poor reviews and sales. In spring 1995, the Cult disbanded, with Ian Astbury forming the Holy Barbarians later in the year. Billy Duffy briefly played with Miles Hunt's Vent 414 before leaving to pursue a solo project. In 2000, the band's catalog was remastered and reissued, and Pure Cult was released in the U.S. (despite a similar compilation, High Octane Cult, having appeared four years earlier). It was followed by Rare Cult, a six-disc box set of rarities.\n\n\nA new Cult with Matt Sorum and Martyn LeNoble joining Astbury and Duffy made their debut in June 1999 at the Tibetan Freedom Festival. This band produced the 2001 album Beyond Good and Evil before the Cult were retired again, as Astbury joined former Doors members Robbie Krieger and Ray Manzarek in the Doors of the 21st Century (later renamed Riders on the Storm). In 2007, it was announced that Astbury had left the band to rejoin Duffy in a new version of the Cult, with Chris Wyse on bass and John Tempesta on drums. They signed to Roadrunner and released Born into This in 2008, which they promoted over the next few years on their highly publicized Love Live tour. They returned to the studio in 2011 after inking a deal with Cooking Vinyl Records and released their ninth studio album, Choice of Weapon, the following year.\n\n \n\nWebsite:\nhttp://thecult.us/\nPrimal Scream\n\nPrimal Scream's career could in many ways be read as a microcosm of British indie rock in the '80s and '90s. Bobby Gillespie formed the band in the mid-'80s while drumming for goth-tinged noise rockers the Jesus and Mary Chain, who were the exact opposite of Primal Scream -- the latter specialized in infectious, jangly pop on its early records. After a brief detour to punky hard rock, the group reinvented itself as a dance band in the early '90s, following through on the pop and acid house fusions of the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. With the assistance of producers Andrew Weatherall and Hugo Nicholson, Primal Scream created the ultimate indie pop and dance fusion album, Screamadelica, in 1991. Screamadelica broke down boundaries and changed the face of British pop music in the '90s, helping to make dance and techno acceptable to the rock mainstream. Instead of following through on the promise of the album, Primal Scream retreated to Stonesy boogie for their 1994 follow-up, Give Out but Don't Give Up. When that record was greeted with indifference, they returned to dance-rock fusions with 1997's Vanishing Point, which re-established the group as a major force in British rock.\n\nSonic Flower GrooveBobby Gillespie (vocals) formed Primal Scream in 1984, while still drumming for the Jesus and Mary Chain. On its initial releases, Primal Scream was a group of '60s revivalists, crafting hooky, guitar-driven pop songs. The band signed to Creation Records in 1985, and over the next year, they released a pair of singles. However, Primal Scream didn't really take off until the middle of 1986, when Gillespie left the Mary Chain and guitarists Andrew Innes and Robert Young joined the band. \"Velocity Girl,\" a rush of jangly guitars, was a B-side that wound up on NME's C86 cassette compilation, a collection of underground pop groups that defined the U.K.'s mid-'80s indie pop scene. The band's debut, Sonic Flower Groove, fit into the C86 sound. After the band rejected the initial version recorded with Stephen Street, they re-recorded the album with Mayo Thompson, and the record was finally released in 1987 on the Creation subsidiary Elevation. The album was well received in the British indie community, as was its 1989 follow-up, Primal Scream, which demonstrated hard rock influences from the Rolling Stones and New York Dolls to the Stooges and MC5.\nAs the '80s drew to a close, Britain's underground music scene became dominated by the burgeoning acid house scene. Primal Scream became fascinated with the new dance music, and they asked a friend, a DJ named Andrew Weatherall, to remix a track from Primal Scream, \"I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have.\" Weatherall completely reworked the song, adding a heavy bass groove echoing dub reggae, deleting most of the original instrumentation (even the layers of guitars), and interjecting layers of samples, including lines of Peter Fonda's dialogue from The Wild Angels. The new mix was retitled \"Loaded,\" and it became a sensation, bringing rock & roll to the dancefloor and dance to rock & rollers. \"Come Together,\" the first single from their forthcoming third album, was in much the same vein, and was similarly praised.\n\nFor their third album, Screamadelica, Primal Scream not only worked with Andrew Weatherall and Hugo Nicholson, the pair who essentially designed the sound of the album, but also the Orb and former Stones producer Jimmy Miller. The resulting album was a kaleidoscopic, neo-psychedelic fusion of dance, dub, techno, acid house, pop, and rock, and it was greeted with rapturous reviews in the U.K. Released in the spring of 1991, Screamadelica also marked an important moment in British pop in the '90s, helping to bring techno and house into the mainstream. The album was a massive success, winning the first Mercury Music Prize in 1992.\n\nXTRMNTR In the wake of the groundbreaking Screamadelica, most observers wondered what Primal Scream would do next, yet few would have predicted their retreat to '70s hard rock for Give Out but Don't Give Up. Released in 1994, the album was eagerly awaited, but its Stonesy hard rock was not well received, and it was a relative commercial failure. More importantly, it hurt the group's reputation as innovators, a situation they reacted to with the title track to the hit 1996 film Trainspotting. Primal Scream's contribution to the soundtrack was a return to the dance stylings of Screamadelica, only darker. The band continued to work on its next album, entitled Vanishing Point, over the course of 1996, finally releasing it to enthusiastic reviews in the summer of 1997. The ultra-aggressive XTRMNTR followed in the spring of 2000. Two years later Primal Scream released Evil Heat, a guest-laden (even supermodel Kate Moss makes an appearance) album in line and on par with XTRMNTR, and in 2006 Riot City Blues came out. Festival shows and gigs with My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields filled out the following year, capped off with the release of the single \"Can't Go Back.\" That single reappeared on the 2008 Suicide and Alan Vega-informed full-length Beautiful Future. In 2011, the band toured in support of the twentieth anniversary of Screamadelica, which resulted in a live DVD. The following year, Mani left to focus on the reunion of the Stone Roses, who Primal Scream went on to support with Debbie Googe from My Bloody Valentine on bass. 2013 began with news that the band were working on their tenth album with producer David Holmes. The resulting More Light was released in the UK in May 2013, appearing in the US a month later.\n\n \n\nWebsite:\nhttp://www.primalscream.net/","artists":[{"id":2478,"name":"Primal

Scream  ist eine britische Rock-Band, deren Musik und Name von der sogenannten Urschrei-Therapie  beeinflusst ist.\r\n\r\nDie Band bestand zunächst aus Bobby Gillespie (ehemals The Jesus and Mary Chain), Andrew Innes, Robert Young, Gary Mounfield (ehemals The Stone Roses) und Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine). Primal Scream wechselten relativ häufig sowohl die Besetzung als auch die Musikstile, das einzig konstante Mitglied ist Bobby Gillespie. Bis 2000 veröffentlichte die Band ihre Platten auf dem Creation-Label, heute sind sie bei Sony BMG unter Vertrag.\r\n\r\nBeginnend als Psychedelic-Rock-Band, deren durch einen formlosen Gitarrensound begleitete Musik instinkthaft und ursprünglich wirken sollte, kombinierten sie bald Rock mit Dance Music. Ihr Album Screamadelica aus dem Jahr 1991 bescherte der Band den weltweiten Durchbruch. Das Album wurde 2011 von der Musikzeitschrift New Musical Express auf Platz 1 der `50 Druggiest Albums Ever` gewählt. Der DJ und Produzent Andrew Weatherall bildete mit seinen Sounds zu dieser Zeit einen maßgeblichen Einfluss auf die Band.\r\n\r\n1994 wechselte die Band in eine Phase, in der sie klassischen Rock im Stile der Rolling Stones spielten, um dann auf komplexe elektronische und dabei auch aggressivere Musik zu wechseln. Das 1997 erschienene Album Vanishing Point war ein Schritt zurück zu den psychedelischen Wurzeln der Band, wohingegen auf den Alben XTRMNTR (2000) und Evil Heat (2002) deutliche Electroclash-Einflüsse zu hören waren.\r\n\r\nPrimal Scream erreichten 2006 mit ihrer Single Country Girl Platz 5 der britischen Singlecharts, ihre bis dato höchste Position in Großbritannien. Das Album Beautiful Future (2008) ist die erste Veröffentlichung von Primal Scream auf dem neuen Label B-Unique. Die erste Single aus dem Album wurde von Paul Epworth (u.a. Bloc Party) produziert. Im Mai 2011 erschien ihre erste Live-DVD Screamadelica Live, im Mai 2013 das neue Album More Light.\r\n\r\nRobert Young, der zunächst Bassist und dann bis zu seinem Ausstieg 2006 Gitarrist der Band gewesen war, verstarb am 9. September 2014 in Hove im Alter von 49 Jahren.[1]","artists":[{"id":2478,"name":"Primal

gegründet, haben Primal Scream in ihrer über 30jährigen Karriere bis heute unzählige jüngere Bands beeinflusst.Angeführt vom ehemaligen Mitglied der Jesus & Mary Chain (die heute auch wieder für Schlagzeilen sorgen) Bobby Gillespie unterzeichneten Andrew Innes (Gitarre), Darrin Mooney (Drums), Martin Duffy (Keyboards) und der ehemalige Stone-Roses-Bassist Gary Mounfield 1985 einen Vertrag mit Alan McGees Creation Records. Der Rest ist Geschichte. Vom Debütalbum „Sonic Flower Groove“ über die Meisterwerke „Screamadelica“ (1991) und „Give Out But Don`t Give Up“ (1994) bis „XTRMNTR“ (2000) und „Evil Heat“ (2002) sowie die jüngeren Werke „More Light“ (2013) und „Chaosmosis“ (2016).2011 sorgte die britische Kultband für einen der Höhepunkte beim Berlin Festival. Spielte die Band um Sänger Bobby Gillespie doch dort ihr legendäres Album „Screamadelica“ komplett durch und überzeugte mit einem beseelten Auftritt. Neben den Wedding Present gehören Primal Scream mit zu den Überlebenden der Indie-Generation von 1986 (C86). Wobei die Band mit „More Light“ und „Chaosmosis“, beweist, dass sie keinesfalls in der Vergangenheit lebt.Wie schon auf dem erwähnten Kultalbum „Screamadelica“ und späteren Werken sind die Briten ihrem Grundprinzip, dem der radikalen Stilvermischung, auch hier treugeblieben. Es treffen sich Brit-Pop und scharfe Gitarrenriffs, geschmeidiger Philly-Soul und dunkler Electro, Neo-Wave, Krautrock, Glam, No Wave und Pop.„Es gibt keine Blaupause für einen Primal Scream-Song, keine Strophe-Bridge-Refrain-Mitte-Formel, die wir immer wieder benutzen“, sagte Mastermind Bobby Gillespie einst.Mit seinen jüngeren Platten ist dem „ewigen Cool-Dude aus der großen Zeit des UK-Raves Anfang der 90er“ (laut.de) ein schönes Album gelungen. “So klingt er, der Rock’n‘Roll im Jahre 2013, gespielt von der ältesten jungen Band der Welt”, lesen wir im „Rolling Stone“.Und zum jüngsten Album aus 2016 schreibt der „Musiksexpress“: „.. auch CHAOSMOSIS klingt wieder nicht wie ein Alterswerk. Nur einmal blicken die Schotten hier auf ihre Vergangenheit zurück – unglücklicherweise gleich am Anfang, was auf eine falsche Fährte lenkt: „Trippin’ On Your Love“ führt mit seinem Rave-Piano-Motiv zurück in den Ecstasy-geschwängerten „Second Summer Of Love“ 1989, der 1991 sein Denkmal mit SCREAMADELICA bekam.Der Rest resultiert beispielsweise in einer stampfenden Kreuzung aus New Order und den Sisters Of Mercy („100 % Or Nothing“), einer Chill-out-Version von „Do It Again“ von den Chemical Brothers namens „I Can Change“. „When The Blackout Meets The Fallout“ gemahnt an den elektronischen 2000er-Frontalangriff der Band, XTRMNTR, und der Synthie-Pop von „Carnival Of Fools“ soll bitte ein später Hit für diesen ewig nachhallenden Urschrei werden.“","artists":[{"id":2478,"name":"Primal Scream","mbid":"55704c38-224f-4b75-b29f-d43653f8bc9a","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6191583.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6191583.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/PrimalScream/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/primalscreamofficial","tracker_count":124766,"url":"PrimalScream","website":"http://www.primalscream.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Gloria Theater","place":"Gloria Theater","city":"Cologne","region":"Germany","country":"Germany","latitude":50.937557,"longitude":6.944892},"ontour_id":"uW7xbsJqS9kLSsQpg","genres":["alternative rock","big beat","britpop","chamber pop","dream pop","electronic","garage rock","indie rock","madchester","neo-psychedelic","new wave","post-punk","space rock","uk post-punk"]},{"id":14024837,"artist_id":2478,"artist_event_id":17762953,"title":"Primal Scream @ Zebedee's Yard in Hull, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-06-23T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Friday, June 23, 2017 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Hull, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2017-03-01T09:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14024837?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Primal+Scream&came_from=67","description":"Primal Scream","artists":[{"id":2478,"name":"Primal Scream","mbid":"55704c38-224f-4b75-b29f-d43653f8bc9a","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6191583.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6191583.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/PrimalScream/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/primalscreamofficial","tracker_count":124766,"url":"PrimalScream","website":"http://www.primalscream.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Zebedee's Yard","place":"Zebedee's Yard","city":"Hull","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":53.742447,"longitude":-0.336376},"ontour_id":"uW7xbsJqS9kLSsQpg","genres":["alternative rock","big beat","britpop","chamber pop","dream pop","electronic","garage rock","indie rock","madchester","neo-psychedelic","new wave","post-punk","space rock","uk post-punk"]},{"id":13014442,"artist_id":2478,"artist_event_id":17630212,"title":"Primal Scream @ Hampden Park National Stadium in Glasgow, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-06-24T17:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 5:00PM","formatted_location":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-09-30T08:30:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13014442?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Primal+Scream&came_from=67","description":"The Stone Roses","artists":[{"id":2478,"name":"Primal Scream","mbid":"55704c38-224f-4b75-b29f-d43653f8bc9a","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6191583.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6191583.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/PrimalScream/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/primalscreamofficial","tracker_count":124766,"url":"PrimalScream","website":"http://www.primalscream.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Hampden Park National Stadium","place":"Hampden Park National Stadium","city":"Glasgow","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":55.825241,"longitude":-4.253201},"ontour_id":"uW7xbsJqS9kLSsQpg","genres":["alternative rock","big beat","britpop","chamber pop","dream pop","electronic","garage rock","indie rock","madchester","neo-psychedelic","new wave","post-punk","space rock","uk post-punk"]},{"id":13282144,"artist_id":2478,"artist_event_id":16706802,"title":"Primal Scream @ Bundoran Beach in Bundoran, Ireland","datetime":"2017-06-25T12:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:00PM","formatted_location":"Bundoran, Ireland","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13282144?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Primal+Scream&came_from=67","description":"Sea Sessions -
