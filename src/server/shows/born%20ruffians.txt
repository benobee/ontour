Ruffians (CA) pop pirate <br />\nLes canadiens de Born Ruffians, autrement dit voyous-nés, nous font profiter de leur pop délicieusement bordélique depuis 2008. Chaque album ayant confirmé leur goût des chansons malignes, narquoises et ébouriffantes, ils n'en restent pas moins élégamment romantiques, habités d'une noirceur sensible jusque dans leurs textes emprunts de spleen adolescent. Des pirates pop venus de l'autre côté de l'océan pour nous faire joyeusement danser.<br />\n\n<br />Cristobal and the Sea (UK) bossa nova psychédélique<br />\nFormé à Londres, le quatuor ressemble à un Erasmus parfait. Les membres de Cristobal and the Sea, venus de France, du Portugal, de Catalogne et d'Angleterre, mêlent leurs influences en une joyeuse bossa nova psychédélique qui n'a rien a envier aux grands de l'indie pop comme Animal Collective, Vampire Weekend ou encore Fleet Foxes. Leur album Sugar Now, enregistré à la lumière lisboète et produit par Rusty Santos (Animal Collective, Grizzly Bear, Beach House) amènera le printemps au Port
