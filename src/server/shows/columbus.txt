Full of excess, amazing bands and awesome people. All held at the best live venue in Brisbane - The Beetle Bar.\r\n\r\nEvery band on this years lineup has a reputation for rocking out harder then anyone else in Brisbane (common theme at EarCandy events). This is going to be the biggest EarCandy yet. For it's price, there is nothing that even vaguely compares. When you don't consider the price, there is still nothing that vaguely compares.\r\n\r\nThis is the greatest show in Brisbane. Make sure you are here to be a part of it.\r\n\r\nStarting things off, we've got the amazing LSD RATKINGS (https://www.facebook.com/lsdratkings). These guys have an awesome laid-back psychedelic type sound which is perfect to get the event underway! Take your drugs or consume your booze. This is the band for it.\r\n\r\nDEADWEIGHT EXPRESS (https://www.facebook.com/DeadweightExpress) are the 2nd band up. These guys are a hard-rocking, blues-soaked, riff heavy band. You won't see anything comparable in Brisbane at the moment. You MUST see these guys!!!\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS (https://www.facebook.com/columbusmakesmusic) are playing third, they killed the audience at EarCandy #2 with their take on 90s-esque punk. You don't want to miss them. Fucking awesome.\r\n\r\nTHE JOHNNY MUSTARDS (https://www.facebook.com/thejohnnymustards) will be making their third EarCandy appearance!!! We love these guys, as do the EarCandy audiences. Their take on punky, bluesy rock n roll is astoundingly unique and awesome. One of the few bands to craft a new sound out of this often-played style. They fucking rock.\r\n\r\nFLANNELETTE (https://www.facebook.com/flanneletterocks) are returning to our stages after blowing the roof off the place at EarCandy #2. These guys have been trotting around Australia doing their hard-rocking, hook heavy thing. You don't want to miss these guys on the night.\r\n\r\nANTI-THESIS (http://www.facebook.com/anti.thesis.music) have played at every EarCandy thus far. We don't expect that to change. Their form of noisy, grungy art-rock combined with improvisation and insane stage presence means you won't be able to take your eyes off these guys. This will be their first EarCandy appearance as a 3-piece. It's going to be fucking awesome. Wonder if David will break any bones this time?\r\n\r\nWHISKEY & SPEED (https://www.facebook.com/whiskeyspeed) are fucking insane. There is no other way to explain them. High speed 'fuck you' rock n roll containing everything from fast dirty-punk to slow heavy as fuck doom and most things inbetween. Known for their psychotic live show. We've gotta hope there will be a stage left once these guys fuck off.\r\n\r\nFinishing the night off and sending the drunks home in style are THE ROYAL ARTILLERY (https://www.facebook.com/theroyalartillery). One of Brisbane's best alternative acts. Their form of blues & groove heavy hard rock is one you don't want to miss. With it's combination of amazing songs, heavy riffage and ultra-grooves. You'll likely lose your pants before the end of their set. Doesn't even matter what style sex you normally go for.\r\n\r\nTHIS is a show you don't want to miss. Make sure you get your asses down and support the Brisbane scene in what is, the best show you'll see in Brisbane. Fucking EarCandy.","artists":[{"id":90813,"name":"Columbus","mbid":"88652883-e335-49b0-b4e0-eaf13812b2d8","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7706098.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7706098.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Columbus/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/columbusmakesmusic","tracker_count":8109,"url":"Columbus","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"EarCandy

March 19th - Columbus 'Replace Me' Sydney Release Show.   \nw/ Special Guests  \nCHECK OUT 'REPLACE ME' HERE: youtu.be/dytgl9VN9Y8  Brisbane punk outfit Columbus are one of the latest additions to the prestigious UNFD roster and they’ve now announced a March tour to celebrate the signing and the release of their brand new single, ‘Replace Me’.  The track was premiered last night on triple j’s Home & Hosed and serves as the first taste from the band’s eagerly anticipated debut album, due out later this year via their new home at UNFD.  “Columbus are a band everyone at UNFD is falling in love with right now,” says UNFD’s Luke Logemann. “They write amazing songs and make them sound even better live. ‘Replace Me’ is already one of the best Australian Summer jams of 15/16!”  “We’re so excited to announce that we’ll be signing to UNFD and working with them on our debut album,” adds vocalist/guitarist Alex Moses. “It’s so great to be able to work with an Australian label so close to home with a team that so enthusiastically wants to support us and our music.”","artists":[{"id":90813,"name":"Columbus","mbid":"88652883-e335-49b0-b4e0-eaf13812b2d8","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7706098.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7706098.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Columbus/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/columbusmakesmusic","tracker_count":8109,"url":"Columbus","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Yah

The band jumped straight into 2016 with a much sought after appearance on Unify. Straight after wooing massive crowds on the festival, the band signed to UNFD (Northlane, In Hearts Wake, Hellions).
