out their brand new summer single ‘My Heart Is Pumping to a Brand New Beat’ https://soundcloud.com/thesubways/my-heart-is-pumping-to-a-brand\r\n\r\nTHE SUBWAYS are one of the most exciting live bands on the current touring circuit, thrilling crowds with their explosive rock sound and wild stage performances. \r\n\r\nBack in 2005, with an average age of just 16, Billy, Charlotte and Josh crashed onto the international music scene with their, now cult, debut album ‘YOUNG FOR ETERNITY’ and rock-club floor filler ‘ROCK & ROLL QUEEN’. The band have released 3 albums to date. The second, ‘ALL OR NOTHING’ (2008), was recorded in LA with producer Butch Vig (credits inc. Nirvana/Sonic Youth) and is a sonically enormous, harder hitting album. The tracks were written at a time when Charlotte and Billy were midst a breakup of their personal relationship and Billy too was battling to save his voice via surgery to remove nodules from his vocal chords caused by strenuous touring. ‘MONEY AND CELEBRITY’ followed in 2011, The band sight the circus of celebrity & money culture and a huge hunger to get crowds going absolutely nuts as the drive behind tracks such as lead single ‘WE DON’T NEED MONEY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME’ which was A-Listed on BBC Radio 1.\r\nIt is truly live where the band hit another level. On the International live circuit The Subways have been earning praise from all corners. Firm summer festival favourites, they have graced the main stages of over 100 international festivals. Whether in front of 100 people or 250,000 the band always deliver a high octane, thoroughly entertaining set…\r\n\r\n“We will rock till we drop, as there is nothing more exciting for us than being on tour. The greatest drug in the world is seeing people screaming the words and dancing to the songs you’ve written. To get up onstage and to play rock and roll every day, to visit new towns, new cities, new countries, new continents and to make new friends along the way, it’s the most amazing experience we’ve ever felt!”  \r\nTHE SUBWAYS are: Billy Lunn (Vocals/ Guitar), Charlotte Cooper (Bass/ Vocals), Josh Morgan (Drums) \r\n\r\nwww.thesubways.net\r\nwww.facebook.com/thesubways\r\nwww.twitter.com/thesubways","artists":[{"id":586,"name":"The Subways","mbid":"20e264d7-b4d5-4e49-8931-a9c67ff07f04","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6466144.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6466144.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheSubways/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thesubways","tracker_count":110808,"url":"TheSubways","website":"http://www.thesubways.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Arts Centre","place":"Arts Centre","city":"Colchester","region":"E4","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.8833333,"longitude":0.9},"ontour_id":"LbWHJC9DBbB7WxK8y","genres":["alternative rock","britpop","dance-punk","garage rock","indie rock","new rave","rock","swedish indie rock"]},{"id":8227767,"artist_id":586,"artist_event_id":9420919,"title":"The Subways @ Gloucester Guildhall in Gloucester, United Kingdom","datetime":"2014-10-02T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Gloucester, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2014-05-26T10:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/8227767?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Subways&came_from=67","description":"The Subways","artists":[{"id":586,"name":"The Subways","mbid":"20e264d7-b4d5-4e49-8931-a9c67ff07f04","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6466144.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6466144.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheSubways/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thesubways","tracker_count":110808,"url":"TheSubways","website":"http://www.thesubways.net"}],"venue":{"name":"Gloucester Guildhall","place":"Gloucester Guildhall","city":"Gloucester","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.865053,"longitude":-2.244948},"ontour_id":"LbWHJC9DBbB7WxK8y","genres":["alternative rock","britpop","dance-punk","garage rock","indie rock","new rave","rock","swedish indie rock"]},{"id":8227809,"artist_id":586,"artist_event_id":9420964,"title":"The Subways @ Boileroom in Guildford, United Kingdom","datetime":"2014-10-04T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 4, 2014 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Guildford, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/8227809?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Subways&came_from=67","description":"Check out their brand new summer single ‘My Heart Is Pumping to a Brand New Beat’ https://soundcloud.com/thesubways/my-heart-is-pumping-to-a-brand\r\n\r\nTHE SUBWAYS are one of the most exciting live bands on the current touring circuit, thrilling crowds with their explosive rock sound and wild stage performances. \r\n\r\nBack in 2005, with an average age of just 16, Billy, Charlotte and Josh crashed onto the international music scene with their, now cult, debut album ‘YOUNG FOR ETERNITY’ and rock-club floor filler ‘ROCK & ROLL QUEEN’.

in 2008, The Square was taken over by a group of people (SquareOne) who were willing to devote their heart, soul, time and energy into giving back to The Square what The Square had given them for over 25 years, it was only ever with the intention of continuing for another six months - that was until a new venue could be found in Harlow where music and the arts in Harlow could thrive for the next 50 years. Eight years later, The Square closed its doors for the last time after hosting some of the world's biggest names under its roof - until now.\n\nAfter Harlow Council's Development Management Committee deemed Circle's redevelopment of the site unsatisfactory, the building has been sat unused for five months, and demand (via petitions, letters to the council, attendance at council meetings, etc) for The Square to reignite the spark it gave us all has flourished. In light of this, SquareOne has decided to reopen the original building with volunteers to demolish and improve the interior to start putting gigs on again. This is so far only a temporary solution to an ongoing issue - nevertheless, it is with a swelling, bubbling, proud and excited heart that we proclaim that we shall once more walk through the doors of The Square, set up, plug in, and make some serious noise - like we have done at least once every year these last fifteen years.\n\nIn the words of SquareOne, \"The story is far from over, so let's get writing this next chapter.\" Hopefully we'll see you all there on 23rd June!","artists":[{"id":586,"name":"The
