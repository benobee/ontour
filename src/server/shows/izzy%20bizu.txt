The professional conference attracted more than 600 delegates from eleven countries, and more than eighty acts played throughout the city over three nights.

We hope to provide the artists with really substantial support to help them achieve recognition.”\r\n\r\nRachael Bee, MD of ILUVLIVE added: “We are really excited about RADAR. Over nearly ten years of running ILUVLIVE, we have often come across acts that we would have liked to support but didn't really fit in with our remit. \r\n\r\n“It's going to be great to offer a broader range of talent support and to have the credibility of Music Week behind the event.”","artists":[{"id":6652669,"name":"Izzy Bizu","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8194549.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8194549.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/IzzyBizu/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/IzzyBizuMusic","tracker_count":33316,"url":"IzzyBizu","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"ILUVLIVE, MusicConnex & Music Week Present RADAR","place":"Under The Bridge","city":"London","region":"England","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.482639,"longitude":-0.18636},"ontour_id":"RbPAkRpMoxvtE74Es","genres":["tropical house"]},{"id":7343194,"artist_id":6652669,"artist_event_id":8016118,"title":"Izzy Bizu @ Supporting Jessy Lanza @ La Fleche D'Or in Paris, France","datetime":"2013-12-05T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, December 5, 2013 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Paris, France","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/7343194?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Izzy+Bizu&came_from=67","description":"Jessy Lanza\r\n\r\nMinimalist. Fragmentary. Slender and elusive. Nothing seems hidden here: each title just a few elements distinctly highlighted. Basic percussion, some synthetic component score an intangible air, and this voice that can both afford to go for the acute and say a few words casually, but always remaining firmly rooted in your synapses. \r\nWhy look? These few agents juxtaposed enough to Jessy Lanza and his sidekick Jeremy Greenspan in their quest for pop constructions related to timelessness. Every word sung by Lanza seems to evaporate in a space created by these songs seemed as simple as fascinating. Whether used as a repeated, as in Diamond Fuck or in vocals sample itself, his voice has a magnetism that is hard to break.\r\n\r\nIZZY BIZU\r\n\r\nIzzy Bizu is an 19 year old singer-songwriter from South West London. Born to an Ethiopian mother and English father she grew up listening to Ella Fitzgerald, Bettye Swann, Betty Wright and James Brown and draws on these alongside new influences, such as Amy Winehouse and Adele to create a fusion of Soul, Funk, Jazz and Pop that sounds classic and brand spanking new all at once.

It’s no surprise that she won when she impressed Emeli Sande and Naughty Boy who were amongst her audience. \n\nSix month’s after her discovery, Izzy's debut EP Coolbeanz caught the attention of Radio

Rugby is proud to announce that IZZY BIZU and JAY PRICE will be joining JESS GLYNNE at Kingsholm Stadium on 18 June.  \n\n22 year-old Izzy Bizu is one of the most exciting breakthrough acts of 2016. Catapulted into the spotlight after being named BRITs Critic’s Choice finalist earlier this year, she has since released tracks ‘White Tiger’, ‘Mad Behaviour’ and latest single ’Someone That Loves You’ (with Honne) to critical and commercial praise. Growing up on a diet of Ella Fitzgerald, Amy Winehouse and Marvin Gaye, Izzy’s delicate acoustica threads those nostalgic funk-and-soul elements with a genuine indie spirit. It was unveiled earlier this week that Izzy’s modern take on the classic Edith Piaf track ‘La Foule’ will be the theme tune for the BBC’s Euro 2016 TV coverage, with her much-anticipated debut album ‘A Moment of Madness’ due out 2nd September via Epic/Sony.\n","artists":[{"id":6652669,"name":"Izzy

Sun kissed pop songs like \"White Tiger\" or the indestructible reggae hit \"Sweat (A La La La La Long)\" are first class songs with chart potential reminding of vacation, heat and the sea. However, Izzy Bizu also knows her subtle joyful soul sound as in \"Mad Behaviour\" which doesn't conceal its ancestors Amy Winehouse or Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nShe professionally trained as a vocalist in London at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute. After graduating she won an open mic contest. But Izzy Bizu is far more than just a voice. She writes her lyrics all by herself. For a long time it was her very own resort having suffered from stage fright. But those times are long gone by now she and her guitar have accompanied Sam Smith on tour and have appeared at Jools Holland's legendary TV show.","artists":[{"id":6652669,"name":"Izzy Bizu","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8194549.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8194549.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/IzzyBizu/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/IzzyBizuMusic","tracker_count":33316,"url":"IzzyBizu","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Reeperbahn Festival","place":"Mojo Club","city":"Hamburg","region":"04","country":"Germany","latitude":53.550058,"longitude":9.967569},"ontour_id":"RbPAkRpMoxvtE74Es","genres":["tropical house"]},{"id":12900272,"artist_id":6652669,"artist_event_id":16190742,"title":"Izzy Bizu @ VEVO HALLOWEEN in Liverpool, United Kingdom","datetime":"2016-10-29T18:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, October 29, 2016 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Liverpool, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2016-09-16T22:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12900272?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Izzy+Bizu&came_from=67","description":"BLOSSOMS / JACK GARRATT / AURORA / IZZY BIZU / SPECIAL GUEST TBA\n\nIt's time to face your phobias.\n\nVevo Halloween is bringing all your deepest and darkest fears to life at Bramley-Moore Dock in Liverpool on Saturday October 29th with a killer lineup.\n\nSerene songstress AURORA, indie heroes Blossoms, pop crooner Izzy Bizu, frenetic multi-instrumentalist Jack Garratt and one final special guest will be making sure that this Halloween party will live long in the memory.\n\nVevo Halloween 2016.

Having toured with Rudimental and Foxes as well as supporting the likes of Sam Smith, Jamie Cullum and Coldplay, Izzy’s music has attracted a significant fanbase ranging from DJs Trevor Nelson and Zane Lowe to super-producer, Naughty Boy. Having played Glastonbury three times and appeared on the Jools Holland show, Izzy’s music has earned her several nominations including the BBC’s Sound of 2016 and she was named as one of the three shortlisted artists for the esteemed Critics’ Choice Award at the 2016 BRITs.\n\nWith her debut album A Moment of Madness out now and huge hits like White Tiger under her belt, expect a vivid, idiosyncratic performance from an artist whose star very much in the ascendancy.","artists":[{"id":6652669,"name":"Izzy
