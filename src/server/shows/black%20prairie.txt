is pretty amazing. Two things just happened.\r\n\r\nJon Mooallem, the popular New York Times Magazine writer and Pop-Up writer-at-large, published his first book, WILD ONES, which is crazy good. Everyone—the New Yorker, New York Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle—is giving it rave reviews. He describes it as \"a sometimes dismaying, weirdly reassuring story about looking at people looking at animals in America.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the band Black Prairie, featuring members of the Decemberists, and fresh off an appearance on the Tonight Show, wrote an album of new music, also called WILD ONES, inspired by the stories in Jon Mooallem's book. They describe it as \"a musical score for the things that you might see in your head when you reflect on certain characters and incidents that you read about in the book.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a unique collaboration.\r\n\r\nPop-Up Magazine is coming back to the Mission, and hosting a live performance at The Chapel, a beautiful new music venue on Valencia Street. Featuring stories about people and animals by special guests, including Michael Pollan, and a feature-length story from WILD ONES told by Jon Mooallem and live-scored by Black Prairie. And then Black Prairie will play a set.\r\n\r\nPop-Up Magazine is going away for a while after this, so come on out. It's going to be really fun.","artists":[{"id":930743,"name":"Black
