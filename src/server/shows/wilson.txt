We’ve got four nights packed to the brim with our special blend of great music and wild energy. And remember, this isn’t your average indie pop fest; opening with the Fucking Awesome Pre-Party on August 10th and wrapping up on the 13th, F.A. Fest flaunts a lineup that spans the entire spectrum of cutting-edge sounds from up-and-coming artists and hardened veterans, not to mention loads of local talent! From hardcore punk to hip-hop all the way to IDM, there is something to please every musical palate.\r\nThis year’s festival will hold performances in nearly every room of the Majestic complex, with shows happening simultaneously onstage in the Magic Stick and the Garden Bowl, in addition to not one but TWO stages on the floor of the Majestic Theatre! The Magic Stick and Garden Bowl’s acts will cover the hip-hop/indie/electronic side of things, while the sonic fare in the Theatre will lean towards heavier material, showcasing hardcore, pop-punk, punk, and post-punk acts.\r\n\r\nSingle-day passes are $15 and four-day passes are only $30. Both are available on Ticketmaster.com and Ticketmaster outlets, UHF Records, as well as the Majestic Box Office (no fees at the box office, holla!).
