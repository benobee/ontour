Allman may have passed in the spring, but his spirit lives on with the \"Laid Back Festival\" that he founded. Close out your summer in style when food, beverages, music and more come together at Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater. The music lineup features many of Allman's friends, like Jackson Browne, who's written and performed some of the most literate and moving songs in popular music and defined a genre of songwriting charged with honesty, raw emotion and personal politics. He came to prominence in the 1970s, gaining fans with such iconic songs as \"These Days,\" \"The Pretender,\" \"Running on Empty,\" \"Doctor My Eyes\" and \"Take It Easy.\" British rock icon Steve Winwood possesses one of the most captivating voices in popular music, as front man for such legendary bands as Traffic and as a solo artist with a string of hits. His '80s era chart-toppers include memorable classics like \"Higher Love,\" \"Roll With It,\" \"While You See a Chance\" and \"Back in the High Life Again.\" These heavy hitters are joined by Peter Wolf, Jaimoe's Jasssz Band, Garland Jeffreys and Scott Sharrard & The Brickyard Band. The one-day event also celebrates New York's diverse food and drink, and a plethora of restaurants, food trucks, breweries, wineries and other artisans will be on hand for your dining and drinking pleasure.","artists":[{"id":31017,"name":"Steve
