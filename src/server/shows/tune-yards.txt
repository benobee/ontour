Planet Entertainment and Noise Pop, along with Paradigm Agency's Oakland office present a OAKLAND UNITED, a benefit show at the Fox Theater in Oakland on Wednesday, December 14th for the Oakland Fire Relief Effort.\n\nThe general on sale begins Friday, December 9th at noon via Another Planet's official website, www.APEConcerts.com.\n\n*100% of the proceeds from ticket sales will go directly to Gray Area Foundation For The Arts Oakland Fire Relief Fund.\n\nAbout OAKLAND UNITED:\nOakland United is a A Night of Music and Stories featuring Boots Riley (The Coup), Christopher Willits, Dan Deacon, Gabe Meline (KQED) Geographer, Hieroglyphics, Jay Som, Josette Melchor (Gray Area), Primus, Rogue Wave, Sam Lefebvre (East Bay Express), Sidecar Tommy (Beats Antique), Thao Nguyen, tUnE-yArDs, Tycho and many more!\n\nThe evening will be hosted by Josette Melchor of the Gray Area Foundation For The Arts, which started a fund shortly after the tragedy and has collected over $500,000 to date. The fund is collaborating closely with the Oakland Mayor’s Office and the Red Cross as well as getting guidance from local arts institutions. The immediate needs of fire victims will be the fund’s priority with the Red Cross as the first point of contact for allocation of the funds received from the Oakland Sports Teams funds. Gray Area will be second point of contact after that and are working on a system for intake. When the immediate needs of families are resolved, Gray Area will be turning their attention to longer-term issues of safety and resilience across the larger creative community, applying efforts to ensure this tragedy is not repeated.\n\n“It is unfortunate that it takes a tragedy to shed light on a broader situation around the need for safe venues for artists, musicians, and creatives in the Bay Area,” said Josette Melchor, Executive Director and Founder of Gray Area Foundation For The Arts. “We will continue to increase this goal as support comes in. We want this funding to stay in the community that was impacted.”","artists":[{"id":192158,"name":"Tune-Yards","mbid":"fac3ff34-6ba4-425a-8f01-b181ef4a908a","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8239437.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8239437.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Tune-Yards/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/tuneyards","tracker_count":133586,"url":"Tune-Yards","website":"http://tune-yards.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Oakland United - A Benefit for Oakland Fire Relief","place":"Fox Theater","city":"Oakland","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":37.807772,"longitude":-122.270194},"ontour_id":"8KqEJ5NjZipD7aNaH","genres":["alternative dance","chamber pop","chillwave","dance-punk","dream pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie r&b","indie rock","indietronica","lo-fi","neo-psychedelic","new rave","new weird america","noise pop","nu gaze","shimmer pop","stomp and holler"]},{"id":12153503,"artist_id":192158,"artist_event_id":15176860,"title":"Tune-Yards @ My Morning Jacket's One Big Holiday (DJ set - Feb 4-8) in Solidaridad, Mexico","datetime":"2017-02-04T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Solidaridad, Mexico","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12153503?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Tune-Yards&came_from=67","description":"DJ set - Schedule TBA","artists":[{"id":192158,"name":"Tune-Yards","mbid":"fac3ff34-6ba4-425a-8f01-b181ef4a908a","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8239437.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8239437.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Tune-Yards/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/tuneyards","tracker_count":133586,"url":"Tune-Yards","website":"http://tune-yards.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"My Morning Jacket's One Big Holiday (DJ set - Feb 4-8)","place":"Hard Rock Hotel Riviera Maya","city":"Solidaridad","region":"Qroo","country":"Mexico","latitude":20.5041,"longitude":-87.22833},"ontour_id":"8KqEJ5NjZipD7aNaH","genres":["alternative dance","chamber pop","chillwave","dance-punk","dream pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie r&b","indie rock","indietronica","lo-fi","neo-psychedelic","new rave","new weird america","noise pop","nu gaze","shimmer pop","stomp and holler"]},{"id":14854631,"artist_id":192158,"artist_event_id":18921830,"title":"Tune-Yards @ Noise for NOW Festival in Santa Fe, NM","datetime":"2017-09-09T18:00:01","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 6:00PM","formatted_location":"Santa Fe, NM","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14854631?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Tune-Yards&came_from=67","description":"Come see us play a truly rare set with Bon Iver, TV on the Radio and others at the Noise for NOW benefit, supporting the work of the Santa Fe chapter of the National Organization for Women.
