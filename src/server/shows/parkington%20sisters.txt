On each of these four Fall days, ten or more separate stages offer events simultaneously for audiences of 100 to 2,000 people. Originally held in Waterloo Village, the Festival found a new home in Newark’s Downtown Arts District in 2010.\r\n\r\nThe poets who have appeared at the Dodge Festival are a veritable who’s-who of American and international poets.

S. Merwin, Adrienne Rich, William Stafford, Gerald Stern, Ruth Stone, and others. Many of today’s most noted younger poets gave their first major reading at the Dodge Poetry Festival, including Elizabeth Alexander and recent Pulitzer Prize winner Natasha Tretheway. The Festival has welcomed participants from every part of the globe, including Nobel Laureates Octavio Paz and Derek Walcott, as well as Chinua Achebe, Bei Dao, Yehuda Amichai, the United Kingdom’s Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, and Korea’s most prolific and respected living poet, Ko Un. Moreover, the Dodge Poetry Festival is the one place where the most influential poets from a wide range of schools of poetry – from Poets Laureate to Slam Champions – have routinely shared the same stage.\r\n\r\nAn essential component of each Festival is a series of special programs for high school students and teachers of all grade levels, elementary through college.

The acclaimed eight-part The Language of Life series was filmed at the 1994 Festival, providing a look at the overall activities of the Festival and in-depth conversations with the featured poets.

US and UK duos The Pierces, The Lost Brothers and The Rails are already renowned as spine-shivering harmonisers, as are Wailin’ Jennys co-founder Ruth Moody and The Parkington Sisters. Rising stars Dawn Landes, from Kentucky, and New Zealand’s Tiny Ruins complete the guest-list, with musical director Roddy Hart and his Lonesome Fire crew once again serving as house
