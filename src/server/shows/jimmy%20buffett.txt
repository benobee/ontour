The Parrothead community is one of the great followings in music history, on par with Deadheads. Arriving at the Red Rocks parking lot, you might be momentarily disoriented by the atmosphere, more carnival-in-the-Keys than concert tailgate. You might see portable tiki bars set up, with smiling faces blending up frozen concoctions to help you hang on. There may be fans toasting doobs to the Coral Reefers in appropriate fashion. Hell, you may even witness a wedding between two Hawaiian-shirt-clad parrotheads, attended by more concertgoers in luau attire and conducted by an actual judge in a grass skirt and lei. And if you scalped a pair of fourth-row seats for only $15, all the better. Because that's the magic of Jimmy Buffett. His music brings people together in celebration of all the good things in life — good food, cold booze, and carefree fun. It's why he's maintained that following for more than four decades.","artists":[{"id":738,"name":"Jimmy
