Stapp’s artistic and personal journey have encompassed all the talent and torment imaginable in scaling to musical success. The founding member of Creed chronicled his questions, his quest for answers, and his dreams from faith to fatherhood in chart topping hits, “My Own Prison,” “Higher,” and “With Arms Wide Open,” which dominated the sonic landscape of the 90s-2000s. His soul-piercing lyrics backed by thundering rock riffs garnered a Grammy award, and countless other accolades of creativity and chart domination, not to mention legions of fans, who felt a kindred spirit in his honesty.\n\nCreed toured extensively through its reign atop rock music, but for Scott, the musical machinery to keep the show going meant some terrible personal cost, as he sunk into depths of depression, prompting self-medication that turned to addictive behaviors. His creativity, passion, and desire to be transparent in his struggle never waned, and were evident on his debut solo album, The Great Divide (2005), the Full Circle album from a “rebirthed” Creed in 2009, several tours, his starkly revealing memoir, Sinner’s Creed (2012), and his highly-acclaimed second solo album, Proof of Life, in 2013, which brought Scott’s first number one song on the Christian charts.\n\nWith the love and support of his family, Scott has continued to live a balanced, healthy and sober lifestyle, grounded in faith. He has a fresh purpose in performing, writing, and singing, to bring hope to “even one person” who is amidst the kind of struggle he knows. Hope has always been a theme of his music, and now, that level of hope takes on a whole new dimension.\n\nIn gratitude for the many interventions made in his behalf, Scott devotes himself to “paying it forward” to others in need through numerous outreaches. He created the “With Arms Wide Open Foundation” in 2000 to help underprivileged children and families around the world. The foundation has donated over $1 million to various causes. He is also involved with CHARM (Children are Magical) which his wife founded to heighten the awareness of children’s issues and provide underprivileged youth with the tools to enrich their lives.\n\nScott performed across the country in 2016 ending a successful solo tour with an international tour with his first-ever stops in South Africa this past December. In addition to his thriving solo career, Scott is also the lead singer of the new super group Art of Anarchy who’s first album with Scott “The Madness” is due out March 24th. Scott will be celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Creed’s “My Own Prison” with his “Live and Unplugged” tour in May and June of this year.  \n\nCurrently Scott resides in Brentwood, TN with his wife, Jaclyn, and their children where he is writing new songs and balancing touring with Art of Anarchy and his solo band. \n","artists":[{"id":3687,"name":"Scott Stapp","mbid":"82ee7141-6b93-42fa-9fbc-faf2fc964870","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/7194791.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/7194791.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ScottStapp/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ScottStapp","tracker_count":52294,"url":"ScottStapp","website":"http://scottstapp.wordpress.com"},{"id":147476,"name":"Willet","mbid":"01f1bd55-aaa4-461e-b8bd-cce4b42ea5e1","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Willet/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/willetonline","tracker_count":3213,"url":"Willet","website":"http://www.willetonline.com"},{"id":4766,"name":"Art Of Dying","mbid":"61dedf14-34cf-41ff-af89-68d66faf3860","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/ArtOfDying/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Art%20Of%20Dying/19630531704","tracker_count":98396,"url":"ArtOfDying","website":"http://www.artofdyingmusic.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Midnight Rodeo","place":"Midnight Rodeo","city":"Mobile","region":"AL","country":"United States","latitude":30.683001,"longitude":-88.297401},"ontour_id":"4pbidRBMNiWPveSLK","genres":["alternative metal","christian alternative rock","grunge pop","nu metal","post-grunge","rap metal"]},{"id":14146766,"artist_id":3687,"artist_event_id":17932504,"title":"Scott Stapp @ Dixie Roadhouse in Cape Coral, FL","datetime":"2017-05-13T18:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 6:30PM","formatted_location":"Cape Coral, FL","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14146766?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Scott+Stapp&came_from=67","description":"Scott Stapp’s artistic and personal journey have encompassed all the talent and torment imaginable in scaling to musical success.

He is also involved with CHARM (Children are Magical) which his wife founded to heighten the awareness of children’s issues and provide underprivileged youth with the tools to enrich their lives.\n\nScott performed across the country in 2016 ending a successful solo tour with an international tour with his first-ever stops in South Africa this past December. In addition to his thriving solo career, Scott is also the lead singer of the new super group Art of Anarchy who’s first album with Scott “The Madness” is due out March 24th. Scott will be celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Creed’s “My Own Prison” with his “Live and Unplugged” tour in May and June of this year. \n\nCurrently Scott resides in Brentwood, TN with his wife, Jaclyn, and their children where he is writing new songs and balancing touring with Art of Anarchy and his solo band.

Tickets go on sale today at noon CST at rockhouselive.com. \n\nInspired by the 20thanniversary of Creed’s “My Own Prison,” the tour offers fans personal and intimate performances that first drew them into the power, angst and raw emotion of the songs on that mega-selling debut album. Reminiscent of “MTV Unplugged” and VH1’s “Storytellers,” the stripped-down acoustic performances will create an unfiltered environment where the songs will speak, and the lyricist who brought them to life will share behind-the-scenes details of its creation. Joining Stapp on tour when “Live and Unplugged” kicks off in May and June will be legendary rock guitarist, accomplished singer, songwriter and producer Ron “Bumblefoot” Thal, formerly of Guns N' Roses, and current Art of Anarchy bandmate. Supporting acts for the tour include Art Of Dying.\n\nZach Bair, president of RockHouse Live Media Productions, Inc., and CEO of DiscLive (disclivenetwork.com) and VNUE, Inc. (OTC:VNUE – vnue.com), said “we are extremely excited to announce this intimate engagement with Scott at RockHouse Live. It has been about 17 years since he last performed in Memphis, with Creed. And on a personal note, I’ve had the pleasure to work with his fellow Creed bandmates in Alter Bridge on live recordings, and for me, having Scott play in my venue brings it full circle.” \n\nIn August of 1997, Creed released “My Own Prison.” Almost instantly, the band was catapulted from being known as the best band in Florida clubs to being America's premier hard rock band. Once the passion of Creed’s captivating live performances met with the production mastery and musical talents of John Kurzweg, there was no turning back. The album showcased the intrinsic connection between songwriters Scott Stapp and Mark Tremonti, a brilliant artistry that continued throughout their collaboration. The record initially cost only $6,000.00 to produce, and remains one of the top-selling albums of all time. It generated four Top 5 singles, certified 6x platinum by RIAA, and is one of the top 200 selling albums of all time in the United States. \n\nFor Stapp, 2016 was a packed year filled with touring, songwriting, and collaborations. In between segments of his solo “Proof of Life” Tour, Stapp was also writing, rehearsing, and performing with the super group, Art of Anarchy. Today, celebrating his twenty year career, Stapp reflects how the influence of “My Own Prison” enriched his journey over the last two decades. Stapp says, \"It still feels like yesterday, the four of us jamming these songs in a basement in Tallahassee, FL not having a clue that these songs would change our lives forever. “My Own Prison” started it all for us. This was the breakthrough album that started Creed's career. It still amazes me that I hear songs from this record played on the radio today. I'll be playing a collections of songs from this record as well as my entire career to date. Bumblefoot and I even have a couple new Art of Anarchy songs in store for the fans.\"\n\nTickets go on sale Thursday, April 20th, 2017, promptly at noon central, and are available at www.rockhouselive.com.
