The song is the first single\r\nfrom their upcoming new studio, which is slated for an early 2014 release.\r\n\r\nBlack Uhuru are a Jamaican reggae group formed in the Waterhouse district of Kingston Jamaica in 1972, initially as Uhuru (Swahili for 'freedom'). Over the years, Black Uhuru have released many successful albums and remained one of the most important and highly influential reggae artists in the world. Black Uhuru's album \"Red\" was ranked #23 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest albums of the '80s, they have won a Grammy Award for \"Best Reggae Album\" and been nominated five times throughout their career. The group have also scored a number one single in the UK for their now classic track \"What is Life?\". In addition to their other accomplishments, Black Uhuru is the only reggae group to have won the Diamond Awards of Excellence.\r\n\r\nThroughout their career, Black Uhuru have become ambassadors of reggae on a worldwide scale and influenced countless artists around the globe. With 14 full length albums, 7 instrumental dub albums, and 4 live albums they have the highest record sales in Reggae music behind Bob Marley.\r\n\r\nMoe's Alley presents the long awaited return of TURBULENCE backed by the I-Sight Band.\r\n\r\nABOUT TURBULENCE\r\nTURBULENCE - Video In Studio \"Neva Knew\"\r\nTURBULENCE - Video \"Notorious\"\r\nSheldon Campbell aka “TURBULENCE”, Mannings Hill Road, Jamaica, West Indies. Turbulence is widely acknowledged as being discovered by Philip ‘Fatis’ Burrell, although his\r\nfirst recording, ‘Keep It Going’, was actually recorded with Sky High.\r\nTurbulence’s initial foray into the Jamaican music industry faltered and it was not until 2000 that he enjoyed notoriety with Burrell’s Exterminator crew having recorded ‘Word Wid It’ in 1999. Widely considered a ‘sing-jay’ he effectively combined ragga, hip-hop and R&B that resulted in a unique style.\r\nTurbulence’s sound leaned heavily towards the US market and led to unwarranted trepidation from the purists. The Exterminator crew also featured artists such as Sizzla and Prince Malachi with whom Turbulence toured in the summer of 2000.\r\nThe tour covered Europe and included a highly acclaimed appearance at the Montreux International Jazz Festival. In the same year he released ‘Where Are Your Wings’, a release that proved sufficiently popular to inspire Burrell to record\r\nTurbulence’s self-titled debut. The release demonstrated his R&B leanings with the track ‘Hold The Faith’, that was also utilized by label-mate Malachi on his debut Watch Over We. Sing-jays are often considered to be second-rate vocalists but Turbulence proved otherwise as he was able to sing in a sensitive style as well as demonstrating his skills as a hardcore dancehall DJ. The debut was deemed a mixed bag and featured dancehall classics such as, ‘Hotness A Gwan’, ‘Nah Beg No Friend’ and ‘Living In Sufferation’.\r\nTURBULENCE, now on tour ... And in association with the Mark Miller Company, TURBULENCE is an Artist no music fan should miss.","artists":[{"id":25921,"name":"Black

“Duckie” Simpson the “Gong Gong Gullie” is the founder and leader for reggae’s BLACK UHURU. Although going through numerous lead singers and musicians they have remained to be one of the most recognized and prolific reggae band for over 50 years.\n\nThe roots of BLACK UHURU were formed in Kingston Jamaica’s Waterhouse district also known as “Firehouse” in the early 60′s. Though considered to be one of Jamaica’s toughest neighborhoods it’s home to several other reggae singers and musicians. It was where Duckie Simpson grew up and learned to sing from boyhood friends Winston “Pipe” Matthews and Lloyd “Bread” McDonald of Wailing Souls and Bob Marley. He recorded four tracks with Wailing Souls before forming his own group.\n\nThe original Uhuru’s (Swahili for freedom) were Derrick “Duckie” Simpson, Euvin “Don Carlos” Spencer and Rudolph “Garth” Dennis. They only recorded a few singles “Folk Songs” “Time Is On Our Side” and “Slow Coach” before separating. Don went solo and Garth joined Wailing Souls.\n\nDuckie reformed the group adding Michael Rose &amp; Errol “Tarzan” Nelson, both from Waterhouse. They recorded their debut album “Love Crises” in 1977 at Prince Jammy’s famous studio in Waterhouse on St. Lucia Road. It was later re-released as “Black Sounds Of Freedom”. Errol later left to join The Jayes. He was soon replaced by American female singer &amp; dancer Sandra “Puma” Jones. They teamed up with drummer Sly Dunbar and bass player Robbie Shakespeare. Together they developed a musical style full of deep bass thumps, loud drum slaps, sharp keyboards, long instrumentals with guitar riffs, whirly back round noises, echos and the signature”woh oh oh’s” creating they’re “classic” sound. Producing hits like “I Love King Sellassie, “‘Shine Eye Gals”, “General Penitentary” and “What is Life”.\n\nBLACK UHURU released the albums Red, Chill Out, Sensemila and Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner and began to tour the world bringing them to international audiences. It was during this period they started to gain rapid popularity. They opened live shows for the Rolling Stones and the Police. They began to work with other well accomplished producers and musicians. Keith Richards played guitar for the “Shine Eye Gal” track. Dennis Brown “The Crown Prince of Reggae” produced the tracks “Rent Man” and Wood For My Fire”. The track” Spongi Reggae” appeared on an episode of The Bill Cosby Show and “Party in Session” in the movie 1980′s North Shore. BLACK UHURU made reggae history when they won the first ever Grammy Award for reggae music in 1984 for the album Anthem Shortly after the grammy Michael Rose went solo. \n\nAnother Waterhouse resident named Delroy “Junior” Reid became the new lead singer. They released two albums Brutal and Positive. The Brutal album was nominated for a grammy. They filmed three music videos for the tracks “Fire City” “Brutal”, and “Great Train Robbery”, that track also played on a popular video game Grand Theft Auto. Sadly in 1990, due to ill health, Sanda “Puma” Jones passed away of cancer. Junior Reid shortly went solo.\n\nThen the original three re-united. They released four albums Now, Iron Storm, Mystical Truth and Strong. Each album was nominated for grammy. They made an award winning music video for the track “Tip Of The Iceberg” featuring rap star Ice-T in 1992. Eventually splitting up again. Carlos &amp; Dennis left again &amp; Duckie stayed again. This time there was a lawsuit brought amongst the group over the band’s legal rights in Los Angeles county court. Derrick Simpson won.\n\nAs the new melenium approached there came a new lead singer yet again from Waterhouse named Andrew “Bee’s” Beckford. They released two albums. Unification was produced by King Jammy &amp; Dynasty was produced by Fitzroy Francis &amp; Duckie. They went on a worldwide tour featuring Sly and Robbie and had the famous producer Scientist as its road engineer. Andrew Bee’s then went solo.\n\nIn 2007 Duckie &amp; Michael Rose reunited after twenty years. They performed in Jamaica and did one international tour and released the single “Dollars”. In 2011 Duckie reunited with Andrew Bee’s after ten years. He added female backing vocalist Kaye Star and began touring again performing in South America &amp; America.\n\nBLACK UHURU recently performed in a Broadway Musical. The red carpeted event “Loving the Silent Tears: A New Msuical” premiered October 27th 2012 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles Ca. They were invited to represent reggae music and performed a new track “Make A Deal”. And in Las Vegas Nevada BLACK UHURU was recently honored for its contribution to the entertainment industry. August 31st if now officially “Black Uhuru Day” in the city of Las Vegas.\n\nBLACK UHURU’s long success has allowed them to become ambassadors of reggae while earning several achievements in the music industry. With 14 full length albums, 7 instrumental dub albums, and 4 live albums they have the highest record sales in reggae music behind Bob Marley. The album Red was voted #23 for Rolling Stone’s list of “100 Greatest Albums of the 1980′s. Aside from winning the first reggae grammy they have been nominated 5 more times. They are the only reggae group to have won the Diamond Awards of Excellence in 1994.\n\nDespite all of BLACK UHURU’s change of different singers and musicians the one thing that has always remained is Derrick “Duckie” Simpson. Much respect to a legendary figure for Reggae Music. The group is presently working on releasing a new album soon to come. It features Duckie on lead.","artists":[{"id":25921,"name":"Black Uhuru","mbid":"8ee00333-ec2c-439b-a619-ae160aca2a15","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/287137.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/287137.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BlackUhuru/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/BlackUhuruOfficial","tracker_count":34626,"url":"BlackUhuru","website":""}],"venue":{"name":"Humboldt Brews","place":"Humboldt Brews","city":"Arcata","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":40.86997,"longitude":-124.087052},"ontour_id":"CvB2G73j5z6WrzP2z","genres":["dancehall","dub","lovers rock","reggae","reggae fusion","rock steady","roots reggae"]},{"id":14478071,"artist_id":25921,"artist_event_id":18408434,"title":"Black Uhuru @ Nectar Lounge in Seattle, WA","datetime":"2017-09-20T07:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:00AM","formatted_location":"Seattle, WA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14478071?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Black+Uhuru&came_from=67","description":"9.20 Wednesday (Reggae)\nNectar, KEXP’s Positive Vibrations & The PBJ Present:BLACK UHURU\nCannon LIon of Judah\n$20 early advance (first 50 tickets)$25-30 general advance\n8pm doors\n21+\n\n\nNectar Lounge\n412 N 36th St\nwww.nectarlounge.com\n\n\n\nBOOTH RESERVATIONS NOW AVAILABLE!\n\nWe are a majority standing-area venue with seating on our heated and covered patio as well as our newly remodeled mezzanine.  All seating is first come first serve however, we do have eight booths available for reservations on our mezzanine.

Over the years, despite several line-up changes, Black Uhuru has released many successful albums and remained one of the most important reggae artists in the world. Derrick \"Duckie\" Simpson, Garth Dennis, and Don Carlos started the group in the early seventies. Subsequently, Carlos left to pursue a solo career, as did Dennis to join The Wailing Souls. Simpson formed a new version of Uhuru with Errol Nelson (of The Jayes) and Michael Rose, taking the name Black Sounds Uhuru. Their Prince Jammy-produced debut album, Love Crisis, was released in 1977. Nelson returned to The Jayes in late 1977, and was replaced the following year by Sandra \"Puma\" Jones, a social worker from South Carolina USA, and the band now took on their most familiar name, Black Uhuru.","artists":[{"id":25921,"name":"Black Uhuru","mbid":"8ee00333-ec2c-439b-a619-ae160aca2a15","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/287137.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/287137.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/BlackUhuru/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/BlackUhuruOfficial","tracker_count":34626,"url":"BlackUhuru","website":""}],"venue":{"name":"B.B.

to the Redwood Cafe Stage Grammy Award Winner Black Uhuru with Special Guest from Belgium, Onesty. \nDJ Loisaida mixing the good grooves!\n\n\n\nDerrick “Duckie” Simpson, the “Gong Gong Gullie” is the founder and leader for reggae’s BLACK UHURU. Rounding out the current line-up is Andrew “Bee’s” Beckford. Although going through numerous lead singers and musicians, they have remained one of the most recognized and prolific reggae band for over 50 years. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe roots of BLACK UHURU were formed in Kingston Jamaica’s Waterhouse district also known as “Firehouse” in the early 60′s. Though considered to be one of Jamaica’s toughest neighborhoods it’s home to several other reggae singers and musicians. It was where Duckie Simpson grew up and learned to sing from boyhood friends Winston “Pipe” Matthews and Lloyd “Bread” McDonald of Wailing Souls and Bob Marley. He recorded four tracks with Wailing Souls before forming his own group. \n\n\n\n\n\nBLACK UHURU made reggae history when they won the first ever Grammy Award for reggae music in 1984 for the album Anthem. As the new millennium approached, there came a new lead singer yet again from Waterhouse named Andrew “Bee’s” Beckford.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite all of BLACK UHURU’s change of different singers and musicians the one thing that has always remained is Derrick “Duckie” Simpson. Much respect to a legendary figure for Reggae Music. The group is presently working on releasing a new album featuring Duckie on lead.\n\n\n\n\n\nUhuru means freedom in Swahili.\n\n\n\nBand website:\nhttp://blackuhuruofficial.com\n\nVenue
