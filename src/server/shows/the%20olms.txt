King, a former resident of Long Beach. Pete and J.D.’s new project is called Olms, which feels like a bit of a 60s throw-back; both musically, with its sunshine pop meets 1st wave Brit-pop song structures, as well as its experimental edge, and heart-on-its-sleeve sense of fun. The Olms new self-titled album is loaded with rich hooks and harmonies and both heartfelt and darkly hilarious lyrics.\r\n\r\n“This may be their first record, but it plays more like long-lost mellow 70s gold. ‘On The Line’ is basically going to be your official 2013 summer jam. This is a perfect slice of lo-fi weirdness: moody and textured, with the light touch of pop geniuses. At the end of the day, these guys are master musicians and extra-master songwriters, and this record will be in your rotation for a while” – 9:30 Club Review\r\n\r\nTHE BLANK TAPES \r\n“Evokes Belle and Sebastian, Pavement, and The Black Keys – in a San Fran coffeehouse (just like the old days).” – ROLLING STONE\r\n“’50s and ’60s pop classics with ramshackle warmth.” – SPIN\r\n“Yoke a garage-pop sensibility to ferocious rock riffs.” – THE NEW YORKER\r\n“Perfectly classic sound.” – SF BAY GUARDIAN\r\n“Awesome every time.” – LA WEEKLY\r\n\r\nSONG PRESERVATION SOCIETY\r\n“What the Shins are to the movie Garden State, Song Preservation Society could be to a potential Golden State. SPS write songs of love and life as taught by their Woodstock predecessors, and these kids have learned it well.”\r\n-Music Connection\r\n\r\n“The laid-back sound of Song Preservation Society lay somewhere between Paul Simon and Bon Iver, leaning to the more modern side of folk. You get glimmers of artistry from yesteryear, but then SPS does something to bring you back to the present. The blending of old and new provides for familiar, yet inspiring territory.”\r\n-LA Music Blog\r\n\r\nMYSTIC RABBIT\r\n\r\nDJ DENNIS OWENS","artists":[{"id":6727400,"name":"The Olms","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6300060.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6300060.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheOlms/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theolmsmusic","tracker_count":9712,"url":"TheOlms","website":null},{"id":174456,"name":"The Blank Tapes","mbid":"3cbf3bdb-be92-4b53-bb02-1e0bbc0dfdc7","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/TheBlankTapes/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":6399,"url":"TheBlankTapes","website":"http://www.theblanktapes.com"},{"id":1681266,"name":"Song Preservation Society","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SongPreservationSociety/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/songpreservationsociety","tracker_count":880,"url":"SongPreservationSociety","website":null},{"id":7327659,"name":"Mystic Rabbit","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/MysticRabbit/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":26,"url":"MysticRabbit","website":null},{"id":7601275,"name":"DJ Dennis Owens","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/DjDennisOwens/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":0,"url":"DjDennisOwens","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Summer and Music at the Pike","place":"Summer and Music at the Pike","city":"Long Beach","region":"CA","country":"United States","latitude":33.7669444,"longitude":-118.1883333},"ontour_id":"bYcoHQAXzMrPaAicd","genres":[]},{"id":6981172,"artist_id":6727400,"artist_event_id":7470259,"title":"The Olms @ Batfest 2013 in Austin, TX","datetime":"2013-08-24T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, August 24, 2013 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Austin, TX","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/6981172?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=The+Olms&came_from=67","description":"The BATFEST\r\nGeneral Admission $7 at the gate day of show cash only!\r\n(10 and under free with an adult admission) \r\nGeneral Admission gets you access to both stages, bats, arts and crafts booths, childrens area, and more!\r\n\r\nSaturday, August 24th, 2013\r\non the Ann Richards Congress Ave Bridge (100 South Congress Ave., Austin, TX 78701)\r\n4 PM until Midnight\r\nAll ages welcome.
