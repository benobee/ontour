Opening set by Horseshoes and Hand Grenades Friday, September 18, 7:00PM Note earlier start time. All September shows start at 7:00. Cloud Cult, originally from Duluth, is an experimental chamber rock band that has sold more than 100,000 albums via their own label, Earthology Records. Started by Craig Minowa, the band is known for its commitment to the environment and for its philosophical lyrics centered on big picture spirituality. Their live shows feature two on-stage painters who create artwork during the concert, as well as a full band complete with violin, cello, trumpet, trombone and French horn. Stevens Point band Horseshoes & Hand Grenades has a lively, celebratory sound strongly rooted in bluegrass, old-time and folk music. This is our festival-style closing night of the season where all the seats are taken out of the tent. Attendees stand and dance in the front and bring lawn chairs to sit in the rear of the tent. It’s become a fun, anticipated tradition as the tent season winds down and the tent is prepared to be packed away for the winter. Tickets: All Seats $28 Standing Room Only or Bring your own lawnchair.","artists":[{"id":7536,"name":"Cloud Cult","mbid":"a33a9cd6-8c03-4047-b62d-59f76f494c20","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8294945.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8294945.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CloudCult/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cloud-Cult/39924774025","tracker_count":45559,"url":"CloudCult","website":"http://www.cloudcult.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Big Top Chautauqua","place":"Big Top Chautauqua","city":"Washburn","region":"WI","country":"United States","latitude":46.6721696,"longitude":-90.8928913},"ontour_id":"jdDvduovNu7SgG5k3","genres":["anti-folk","canadian indie","chamber pop","folk-pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","neo-psychedelic","stomp and holler","stomp pop"]},{"id":11008820,"artist_id":7536,"artist_event_id":13621477,"title":"Cloud Cult @ Gallagher Performing Arts Center in Cedar Falls, IA","datetime":"2016-02-04T19:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 7:00PM","formatted_location":"Cedar Falls, IA","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11008820?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cloud+Cult&came_from=67","description":"Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm  (All Ages) $21","artists":[{"id":7536,"name":"Cloud Cult","mbid":"a33a9cd6-8c03-4047-b62d-59f76f494c20","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8294945.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8294945.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CloudCult/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cloud-Cult/39924774025","tracker_count":45559,"url":"CloudCult","website":"http://www.cloudcult.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Gallagher Performing Arts Center","place":"Gallagher Performing Arts Center","city":"Cedar Falls","region":"IA","country":"United States","latitude":42.5097586,"longitude":-92.4617011},"ontour_id":"jdDvduovNu7SgG5k3","genres":["anti-folk","canadian indie","chamber pop","folk-pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","neo-psychedelic","stomp and holler","stomp pop"]},{"id":11008824,"artist_id":7536,"artist_event_id":13621481,"title":"Cloud Cult @ Papa Charlies in Lutsen, MN","datetime":"2016-02-06T21:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 9:30PM","formatted_location":"Lutsen, MN","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/11008824?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cloud+Cult&came_from=67","description":"Show: 9:30 pm  (21+) $14 Advance or $18 Day of show.

Full cast in attendance. All ages (Cloud Cult will not be performing at this event). \n\n---\nThe Seeker is one of a small handful of feature-length narrative dramas to land on Entertainment Weekly's “Must List”. According to film critic Joe Neumaier of the Tribeca Shortlist, “Anyone who’s ever heard echoes of their childhood during times of crisis or contemplation - meaning, anyone breathing - will be utterly swept away.” The film stars Josh Radnor (Mercy Street, How I Met Your Mother), Alex McKenna (What Women Want), Lillia Gray, Amanda Day and Josie Axelson.\n\nThe story and music were written by Craig Minowa and Cloud Cult, and the film was visually scored and directed by Jeff D.

All ages\n\nTickets go on sale 10am PST Monday May 1: http://bit.ly/2pu0anR\n\n----------------\nThe indie rock band Cloud Cult has a long record of blurring the lines between music and the visual arts. For 15 years, the group has toured with two live painters on stage, along with the band's critically acclaimed mix of rock, electronic and classical instrumentation. \n\nIn 2016, Cloud Cult took it a step further and released what became a multiple award winning feature film The Seeker, wherein the story and the music were written by the band. Cloud Cult toured in support of that album release to sold-out audiences in early 2016 and the partner film, also titled The Seeker has been wooing critics at film festivals and captivating audiences in national theaters since then. \n\nPresale for the U.S. and international digital release of the film will begin in May on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play and Vimeo. To support the digital release, Cloud Cult has announced U.S. national tour dates in June where the band will perform the full score of The Seeker while the film plays on screen behind them, followed by a second set of fan favorites. The tour and release will be kicked off by a May 18th premiere of the film in Hollywood with full cast attending and Q&A. (Details for all of these shows are listed below).\n\nThe Seeker is one of a small handful of feature-length narrative dramas to land on Entertainment Weekly's “Must List”. According to film critic Joe Neumaier of the Tribeca Shortlist, “Anyone who’s ever heard echoes of their childhood during times of crisis or contemplation - meaning, anyone breathing - will be utterly swept away.” The film stars Josh Radnor (Mercy Street, How I Met Your Mother) along with Alex McKenna (What Women Want).\n\nThe Seeker, directed by Jeff D. Johnson of Motion 117 Productions, is the story of Grace, a daughter whose idyllic life is turned upside-down by immense tragedy. As she grows older, her cynicism and apathy towards her new reality is challenged by a reminder from the past that sets her on a pilgrimage that will define her. \n\nThe film won the “BEST OF FEST” in the Visual Music category at the Speechless Film Festival.

During that time, the band grew from the solo project of singer/songwriter Craig Minowa to include the rock band along with violin, cello, trumpet, trombone and French horn. Two live painters create original artwork on stage during each performance. The band has remained independent for the past decade and a half in favor of keeping total control of the ethical aspects of their music and business, despite enticing offers from notable major labels. In the process, Cloud Cult has sold over 100,00 albums out of lead singer/songwriter Craig Minowa's organic hobby farm.","artists":[{"id":7536,"name":"Cloud Cult","mbid":"a33a9cd6-8c03-4047-b62d-59f76f494c20","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8294945.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8294945.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/CloudCult/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cloud-Cult/39924774025","tracker_count":45559,"url":"CloudCult","website":"http://www.cloudcult.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Cloud Cult's Annual Winter Get-Away Show at Lutsen Mountains","place":"Lutsen Mountains - Papa Charlie's","city":"Lutsen","region":"MN","country":"United States","latitude":47.66421,"longitude":-90.714478},"ontour_id":"jdDvduovNu7SgG5k3","genres":["anti-folk","canadian indie","chamber pop","folk-pop","freak folk","indie folk","indie pop","indie rock","lo-fi","neo-psychedelic","stomp and holler","stomp pop"]},{"id":15236640,"artist_id":7536,"artist_event_id":19328747,"title":"Cloud Cult @ Cloud Cult Live with MN Symphony Orchestra (SOLD OUT) in Minneapolis, MN","datetime":"2018-04-07T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, April 7, 2018 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Minneapolis, MN","ticket_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15236640/buy_tickets?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cloud+Cult&came_from=67","ticket_type":"Tickets","ticket_status":"available","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15236640?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Cloud+Cult&came_from=67","description":"SOLD OUT Cloud Cult in concert with the Minnesota Orchestra April 7, 2018 8pm @ Orchestra Hall.
