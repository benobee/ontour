Sedan 2005 har kvintetten från Southend i England gjort sitt bästa för att skriva in sig i musikhistorieböckerna som ett band vars stora gärning är att föra musiken de själva älskar framåt: den garagerock och new wave som bandmedlemmarna pratade om när de DJ:ade och grävde efter obskyr vinyl som ungdomar är roten i musiken de skapar – ofta punkig och rik på oljud och genreblandande men också alltid med en stark melodisk botten och övergripande popådra. De är ibland ett rockband som spelar pop, ibland ett popband som spelar punk, men alltjämt ett band som gärna hämtar från olika stilar för att skapa musiken som är så typisk The Horrors.  Den 22 september släpper The Horrors sitt efterlängtade femte album ”V” som följs av en turné i Europa. Albumet har producerats av Paul Epworth, som tidigare samarbetat med bl.a FKA Twigs, Lorde, Rihanna, Adele, London Grammar, Florence and the Machine, Coldplay, U2 och Paul McCartney.","artists":[{"id":943,"name":"The

tre anni di distanza dall’acclamato album del 2014 “Luminous”, i The Horrorsfanno ritorno sulla scena musicale con “V”, il loro quinto, per l’appunto, album in studio, in uscita il 22 Settembre via Wolftone/Caroline International. Il disco, prodotto da Paul Epworth - già noto per le sue importanti collaborazioni con artisti del calibro di FKA Twigs, Lorde, Rihanna, Adele, London Grammar, Florence and the Machine, Coldplay, U2 e Paul McCartney - è stato anticipato da “Machine”, un singolo dall'andamento ossessivo, dark e industrial che mostra la band pronta a tornare sulla scena con rinnovata energia. Ascolta il singolo \"Machine\": Youtube: https://TheHorrors.lnk.to/MachineYTSo Vevo: https://TheHorrors.lnk.to/MachineVEVOSo La grafica dell'album è stata realizzata dal talentuoso artista VFX e regista Erik Ferguson, noto per la sua visione creativa astratta e intrigante. Ogni loro disco ha sempre rappresentato la tappa di un processo che li ha visti crescere in maniera incredibile. L'evoluzione del suono e la capacità di mutare rappresentano più di ogni altra cosa la loro cifra stilistica. Dopo il tour europeo come special guest per i Depeche Mode, i The Horrors presenteranno le 10 tracce del loro nuovo lavoro in Italia a Dicembre","artists":[{"id":943,"name":"The
