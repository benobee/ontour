8 / Show 8:30\r\nPANIC IS PERFECT: The “panic” in Panic Is Perfect has a lot more to do with adrenaline than it does with anxiety. From the very first notes of the band’s debut full-length, Cellspace, out on Strange Loop Records, there’s a sense of urgent wonder that drives the unique, eclectic and undeniably accessible songs. Each of the 11 tracks has an indisputable energy, but unlike everyday pop songs they feature an impressive array of international influences and surprising sounds—from vibraslaps to french vocal loops —that make for exciting, inspiring and truly multifaceted music.\r\nDANGERMAKER: San Francisco’s champions of overcast pop-heavy rock n’ roll, Dangermaker, have a very solid track record, which their forthcoming Light the Dark III succeeds beyond expectations in furthering. Picking up where they left off with Light the Dark I & II, this collection is defined by classic songwriting, charmingly familiar hooks and a particular style of raw, warm production that flows throughout courtesy of producer Aaron Hellam. The band had an exciting year, including recent festival appearances at Bottlerock Napa and Live 105’s BFD Music Festivals – with headliners like Florence & The Machine, Atlas Genius, Grouplove, Modest Mouse, Cold War Kids and Best Coast – continuing on with US tour dates. Light The Dark III is scheduled for release fall 2016.\r\n\r\nAfter lead singer Adam Burnett’s father suffered a fatal accident and suddenly passed away during the first week of tracking their debut album Black Dream, Adam, Carlos, Dave & Neko plunged into their art with urgency and a newfound lust for life, eventually emerging with a euphoric sound that defines their new releases on Breakup Records. Channeling a signature brand of dark indie pop ala early Killers, Phoenix, and White Lies has propelled the band forward to recent showcases at SXSW, CMJ and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\nABBOT KINNEY: Abbot Kinney is a rock band that thrives on big vocal hooks, a heavy, intricate rhythm section and an ambitiously grand scope, and while lead singer-songwriter Jared Swanson was certainly influenced by the “alternative” label of yesterday, his music wholly belongs to the 21st century. The group’s new EP The Night not only challenges the listener’s conception of what an indie rock song can sound like in a scaled-down, irony-charged modern music scene; it also represents a sonic evolutionary step forward. 2011’s self-titled debut was a solid introduction to the world: polished production values, swirling, complex instrumentation, thematically consistent lyrics. The Night is more personal, more anthemic, the sound of a songwriter coming into his own and finding a distinct, unmatched voice, one full of longing, hope, sometimes doubt but never resignation. A voice that will forever banish the term “alternative” to history. A voice that encapsulates the here, the now, the beautiful and tragic present, and the vision for a brighter future. The forthcoming EP The Night, including the singles “Can We Become”, “We Can’t Stop Now”, and “It’s The Middle of the Night”, is available for purchase HERE.\r\n\r\nTICKET INFORMATION  • Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue. • No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.
