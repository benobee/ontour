Lake Swimmers is de band rondom de Canadese singer-songwriter Tony Dekker.\n\nDe band bracht tot nu toe zes albums uit waarvan de laatste ‘A Forest of Arms’ onlangs verscheen. Dekker is opgegroeid in de buurt van het Eriemeer, in het zuiden van de Canadese provincie Ontario. Hij groeide op met de veranderende weerpatronen, cyclus van de seizoenen heeft de gave om deze thema’s terug te laten keren in zijn teksten en muziek. Samen met zijn bandleden Erik Anesen, Miranda Mulholland, Bret Higgens en Josua van Tassel werd ook het nieuwe album op verschillende locaties opgenomen.\n\nVolgens Dekker komt de akoestische folk, roots en rock van zijn band beter tot zijn recht op verschillende locaties dan in een studio: het krijgt een meer natuurlijke echo en een historische lading mee. Zo werden er een aantal vocalen en gitaarpartijen opgenomen in de Tyendinaga grotten in Ontario, een kerk en een oud schoolgebouw. De nummers van Dekker worden vaak vergeleken met die van Nick Drake, Gram Parsons en Neil Young.","artists":[{"id":33932,"name":"Great Lake Swimmers","mbid":"64deac19-021e-4dc1-8d11-658be8763589","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6021731.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6021731.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/GreatLakeSwimmers/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Great%20Lake%20Swimmers/36738777490","tracker_count":63668,"url":"GreatLakeSwimmers","website":"http://greatlakeswimmers.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Doornroosje","place":"Doornroosje","city":"Nijmegen","region":"The Netherlands","country":"Netherlands","latitude":51.844233,"longitude":5.854236},"ontour_id":"Cs5YiEyzzg57ggWEm","genres":["alternative country","canadian indie","chamber pop","folk christmas","folk-pop","freak folk","indie christmas","indie folk","indie pop","new americana","singer-songwriter","slow core","stomp and flutter","stomp and holler"]},{"id":9894596,"artist_id":33932,"artist_event_id":11967507,"title":"Great Lake Swimmers @ Lille Vega in København V, Denmark","datetime":"2015-09-26T21:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, September 26, 2015 at 9:00PM","formatted_location":"København V, Denmark","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":"2015-05-12T13:00:00","facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/9894596?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Great+Lake+Swimmers&came_from=67","description":"Køb billetter til Marvelous Mosell + special guests hos billetlugen.dk Han er dansk raps svar på John Travolta.

retour des mythiques Flamin' Groovies à Petit Bain, avec dans leurs valises une \"une set list de rêves\" avec des titres originaux, jamais joués sur scène .\n\nVENDREDI 29 AVRIL\nFLAMIN’ GROOVIES\n+ GUEST\nRock’n’roll\n19h00 / 22€ en prévente*, TR, habitants du 13eme / 25€ sur place\n*hors frais de location\n\nL’histoire des Flamin’ Groovies commence en 1965 à San Francisco, sous le nom des » Chosen Few » . Après un changement de nom et la sortie d’un disque autoroduit » Sneakers » , le groupe attire l’attention de Columbia Records, qui les signe et sort leur premier album » Supersnazz » sur le label Epic . Les deux suivants sortent sur le label Kama Sutra : » Flamingo » et » Teenage Head » ( la référence ! ) .\n\nLe chanteur Roy Loney quitte le groupe : il est remplacé par Chris Wilson ( de Loose Gravel ) . Ils continuent leur carrière en Angleterre , toujours dans le même style mais avec des influences beaucoup plus sixties . Au début des années 70, ils sortent plusieurs singles sur United Artists, enregistrés aux mythiques studios Rockfield ( Pays de Galles ) avec Dave Edmunds à la production . En 1976, ils signent avec Sire Records qui sort les trois joyaux power pop : » Shake some action « , » Flamin’Groovies now » et » Jumpin’ in the night » .\n\nUn nouveau changement de line up fait suite au départ de Wilson pour rejoindre The Barracudas . Les Groovies continuent de tourner en Australie et en Europe durant les années 80 et sortent un album souvent négligé, » Rock Juice » ; avant de prendre des voies différentes : Jordan crée un nouveau groupe » Magic Christian » tandis que Wilson sort des albums en solo en Europe .\n\nEn 2013, Jordan, Wilson et le premier bassiste George Alexander sont réunis pour la première fois depuis 1981 . Ils sont accompagné du batteur Victor Penalosa, qui ajoute sa patte tout en gardant le son des anciens albums . Le quatuor est retourné aux studios pour enregistrer des nouveaux morceaux et peaufiner d’anciens titres inachevés . Ils ont récemment tourné au Japon, en Australie, aux USA , à Londres ainsi qu’au Rock & Roll Hall of Fame .","artists":[{"id":33932,"name":"Great Lake
