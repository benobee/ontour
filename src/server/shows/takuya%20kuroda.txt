On his fifth studio album and Concord Records debut, the aptly namedÂ Zigzagger, Kuroda darts between those wide-ranging interests with a funky swagger and an intensely swinging vigor. The deeply infectious album, due out October 7, 2016, finds the trumpeter snaking his way around the opposing poles of acoustic and electric, bristling grooves and blissed-out vibes, punchy brass and fluid synths, carving his own distinctive sonic path along the way.\nâLife is sometimes not that easy, sometimes not so difficult, and it should never go straight,â Kuroda says. âItâs always zigzagging. So I put my soul and spirit into that word.â\nThough it wasnât intentional on Kurodaâs part, the title also canât help but evokeÂ The Sidewinder, Lee Morganâs 1964 classic that became one of the touchstones of the then-burgeoning soul-jazz style. Morgan has been a major influence on Kuroda as a player and as a conceptualist, and withÂ ZigzaggerÂ the 36-year-old trumpeter offers his own take on the state of the soul-jazz art more than half a century later. His music takes into account the electronic innovations of artists like Flying Lotus and J Dilla, while remaining true to the window-rattling funk and soul-stirring grooves which forcefully carry on the tradition.\nKurodaâs vision is realized with the help of his regular working band, most of them friends and collaborators for more than a decade since attending New York Cityâs New School together. They include trombonist Corey King, who also shows off his vocal chops on the simmering neo-soul tune âDo They Know;â bassist Rashaan Carter; drummer and percussionist Adam Jackson; and the bandâs newest addition, keyboardist Takeshi Ohbayashi, who joined up in 2011. Three tracks bolster the band with master percussionist Keita Ogawa, who first crossed paths with Kuroda 20 years ago at jam sessions in their native Japan. Album closer âThink Twiceâ features the electrifying sounds of the popular Brooklyn Afrobeat band Antibalas.\nProduced by Kuroda himself,Â ZigzaggerÂ is more purely an expression of his own distinctive approach. It maintains the unified style and infectious grooves of his earlier work, but mixes things up with more eclectic, shifting inspirations and perspectives. âWhen I write music I see a lot of elements and put them in different places, with different angles, a lot of counterpoint and strong melodies,â Kuroda explains. âItâs always easy to sing to, but has something like advanced changes underneath, kind of hidden so that people donât get confused by the difficult elements. But itâs there. Musicians always tell me my music is easy to listen to but difficult to play.â\nOhbayashiâs burbling, singing keyboards open the album on âR.S.B.D.,â soon punctuated by Jacksonâs forceful, driving rhythms before Kuroda and King burst in with the piquant horn melody. Electronica influences invade midway through the track, with post-production elements including sound effects and wordless vocals transforming the sound from the organic to the constructed, a dichotomy captured by the mash-up title, which stands for âRed Spade Black Diamond.â\nThe title track is built on the Afrobeat sounds that have become a key part of Kurodaâs music since he began working with the New York-based band Akoya Afrobeat nearly a decade ago. That sound recurs in full flourish when Antibalas joins on the Fela Kuti-inspired âThink Twice.â Both show off Kurodaâs gift for combining spiky jazz melodies with buoyant, compelling rhythms.\nThe title of âI Donât Remember How It Beganâ tells the story of its own creation, which began as a heavily electronic Flying Lotus-inspired piece that eventually veered into a much more straight-ahead jazz direction once the band got a hold of it. The name also captures the sensation of getting lost in a powerhouse groove, so transporting that itâs hard to recall where it came from, as the band does in the second half of the cut.\nLate, lamented hip-hop super-producer J Dilla is an obvious influence on âNo Sign,â with its dragging, attitude-laden beat, while a more recent loss is called to mind in the sultry, clever funkiness of the Prince-esque âThirteen.â Kurodaâs vulnerability shows in his playing on âLittle Words,â which suggests that deep meaning can be found in terse, tough phrases. Finally, both the hip-hop driven âActorsâ and the densely layered âGood Day Bad Habitâ feature the dazzling percussion of Keita Ogawa. Both were originally written on Kurodaâs computer, with percussive sounds that he expected to be impossible to replicate in the studio. âOgawa showed up with probably 50 percussion instruments and recreated all these impossible sounds with acoustic instruments,â Kuroda recalls. âHeâs a crazy guy.â\nZigzaggerÂ is the latest stop along a serpentine path that began in Kobe, Japan, where Kuroda followed his trombonist brother into the local music scene. He moved to the U.S. and graduated from the New Schoolâs Jazz and Contemporary Music program in 2006. It was during his time at the New School that Kuroda befriended JosÃ© James, appearing on two of the singerâs albums and writing horn arrangements for his breakthrough album, 2013âsÂ No Beginning No End.\nJames returned the favor by producing Kurodaâs 2014 Blue Note releaseÂ Rising Son. That album followed three earlier independent releases:Â Bitter and HighÂ in 2006,Â EdgeÂ in 2011 andÂ Six AcesÂ in 2012. Heâs become an active member of the diverse and vibrant NYC jazz scene, playing with the likes of JosÃ© James, Akoya Afrobeat, Jesse Fischer, and others. Crossing into the world of hip-hop, heâs been playing with and writing arrangements for the legendary DJ Premier, half of the ground-breaking duo Gang Starr.\nAboutÂ GrÃ©goire Maret:\nGrÃ©goire MaretÂ moved to New York City to study at the New School University's Jazz Department in New York City upon graduating from the prestigious Conservatoire SupÃ©rieur de Musique de GenÃ¨ve. Today he is one of the most sought after harmonica players in the world: often compared to legends Toots Thielemans and Stevie Wonder, he has been asked to play with an incredible number of famous musicians including YoussnâDour, Me' Shell Ndegeocello, Pete Seeger, David Sanborn, George Benson, Cassandra Wilson, to name a few. \nIn 2003 he was the subject of Swiss filmmaker FrÃ©dÃ©ric Baillif's documentary Sideman, which won several awards. In 2005, GrÃ©goire toured with the Pat Metheny Group, receiving a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album for their album The Way Up.

He also recorded an album, Scenarios, with Andy Milne in 2007. In 2010, GrÃ©goire Maret played at The Concert for the Rainforest with Elton John and Sting.\nOn March 13, 2012 Maret released his first album as a leader.Â The eponymous album features such notable guests as vocalist Cassandra Wilson, bassist Marcus Miller, guitarist Raul MidÃ³n, Mark Kibble and Alvin Chea of Take 6, and the legendary harmonica player Toots Thielemans.\nPersonnel include GrÃ©goire Maret: harmonica, vocals; Federico G Pena: piano, taicho harp, percussion, vocals; James Genus: electric bass, vocals, acoustic bass; Clarence Penn: drums, vocals; Bashiri Johnson and Mino Cinelu: percussion; Brandon Ross: soprano acoustic guitar, 6-and-12 string acoustic guitar; Jean-Christophe Maillard: acoustic guitar, taicho harp; Jeff \"Tain\" Watts: drums; Alfredo Mojica: percussion; Cassandra Wilson: vocals; Stephanie Decailet: violin; Johannes Rose: viola; Fabrice Loyal: cello; Marcus Miller: fretless bass; Janelle Gill, Adia Gill, Clyde Gill, Micai Gill: vocals; Toots Thielemans: harmonica; Robert Kubiszyn: acoustic bass; Krzysztof Herdzin: string arrangement; Gretchen Parlato: voice.

On his fifth studio album and Concord Records debut, the aptly namedÂ Zigzagger, Kuroda darts between those wide-ranging interests with a funky swagger and an intensely swinging vigor. The deeply infectious album, due out October 7, 2016, finds the trumpeter snaking his way around the opposing poles of acoustic and electric, bristling grooves and blissed-out vibes, punchy brass and fluid synths, carving his own distinctive sonic path along the way.\nâLife is sometimes not that easy, sometimes not so difficult, and it should never go straight,â Kuroda says. âItâs always zigzagging. So I put my soul and spirit into that word.â\nThough it wasnât intentional on Kurodaâs part, the title also canât help but evokeÂ The Sidewinder, Lee Morganâs 1964 classic that became one of the touchstones of the then-burgeoning soul-jazz style. Morgan has been a major influence on Kuroda as a player and as a conceptualist, and withÂ ZigzaggerÂ the 36-year-old trumpeter offers his own take on the state of the soul-jazz art more than half a century later. His music takes into account the electronic innovations of artists like Flying Lotus and J Dilla, while remaining true to the window-rattling funk and soul-stirring grooves which forcefully carry on the tradition.\nKurodaâs vision is realized with the help of his regular working band, most of them friends and collaborators for more than a decade since attending New York Cityâs New School together. They include trombonist Corey King, who also shows off his vocal chops on the simmering neo-soul tune âDo They Know;â bassist Rashaan Carter; drummer and percussionist Adam Jackson; and the bandâs newest addition, keyboardist Takeshi Ohbayashi, who joined up in 2011. Three tracks bolster the band with master percussionist Keita Ogawa, who first crossed paths with Kuroda 20 years ago at jam sessions in their native Japan. Album closer âThink Twiceâ features the electrifying sounds of the popular Brooklyn Afrobeat band Antibalas.\nProduced by Kuroda himself,Â ZigzaggerÂ is more purely an expression of his own distinctive approach. It maintains the unified style and infectious grooves of his earlier work, but mixes things up with more eclectic, shifting inspirations and perspectives. âWhen I write music I see a lot of elements and put them in different places, with different angles, a lot of counterpoint and strong melodies,â Kuroda explains. âItâs always easy to sing to, but has something like advanced changes underneath, kind of hidden so that people donât get confused by the difficult elements. But itâs there. Musicians always tell me my music is easy to listen to but difficult to play.â\nOhbayashiâs burbling, singing keyboards open the album on âR.S.B.D.,â soon punctuated by Jacksonâs forceful, driving rhythms before Kuroda and King burst in with the piquant horn melody. Electronica influences invade midway through the track, with post-production elements including sound effects and wordless vocals transforming the sound from the organic to the constructed, a dichotomy captured by the mash-up title, which stands for âRed Spade Black Diamond.â\nThe title track is built on the Afrobeat sounds that have become a key part of Kurodaâs music since he began working with the New York-based band Akoya Afrobeat nearly a decade ago.

Innan Kuroda kom till USA vÃ¤xte han upp i Kobe (Japan) och fÃ¶ljde sin trombonspelande storebrors fotspÃ¥r in i skolans storband. AnmÃ¤rkningsvÃ¤rt Ã¤r att Takuya aldrig hade en jazzlÃ¤rare i Japan â istÃ¤llet fick han sina fÃ¶rsta lektioner i musikteori, gehÃ¶r och jazzensemble pÃ¥ engelska vid Berklee College of Music i New York.  Numera Ã¤r trumpetaren baserad i Brooklyn och har pÃ¥ egen hand producerat och slÃ¤ppt tre skivor innan kritikerhyllade albumet Rising Son slÃ¤pptes pÃ¥ anrika Blue Note Records. Han har redan blivit en viktig musikalisk rÃ¶st i New Yorks Afrobeat-scen och med senaste albumet Zigzagger visar Takuya Kuroda att han Ã¤r en musikalisk kraft att rÃ¤kna med.  - Itâs a group that knows how to lock in and lock it down... Kuroda is an artist who knows just where to place a note or start a run.
