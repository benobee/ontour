Stooges, The Ramones, Einstürzende Neubauten, The Shangri-Las: eine ziemlich eklektische Reihe von Einflüssen und eine, die die Brüder Jim und William Reid als The Jesus and Mary Chain aus Lanarkshire, Schottland, dazu inspirierte, eine der einflussreichsten Bands ihrer Ära zu werden. Was folgte war eine Fülle an Kreativität und Kontroverse, in dem die Kraft ihrer Musik - auffallend das Debüt `Psychocandy` - mit der Volatilität ihrer Beziehung abgestimmt wurde. Ihre Reise hatte großen Einfluss. Nicht nur, dass ihr Erfolg Alan McGees Creation Records geholfen hat, in Großbritannien mit den am meisten gefeierten Bands wie My Bloody Valentine, Oasis und Super Furry Animals zu arbeiten, der frühe Schlagzeuger Bobby Gillespie ging seinen eigenen Weg mit Primal Scream. Im Jahr 1998 war die JAMC-Geschichte jedoch vorbei.Irgendwann fanden die Geschwister doch wieder zusammen: „“I’d do it if you do it.” Jim meint dazu: “We thought, ‘Well fuck it, why not? ’ It seems crazy not to. And if we leave it any later maybe we’re gonna be too old.” In ihrer Abwesenheit schien die Liste der Bands, die von der JAMC Pause beeinflusst wurden, weiter anzuwachsen. Sofia Coppolas Gebrauch von“`Just Like Honey“ in der Schlussszene von „Lost in Translation“ gab einer neuen Generation die Möglichkeit, JAMC zu entdecken. In den folgenden Jahren versuchte Coachella wiederholt, sie zu überreden, die Band zu reformieren: Eine Hartnäckigkeit, die schließlich belohnt wurde, als JAMC 2007 ihr großes Comeback feierten, begleitet von einem besonderen Gast: Scarlett Johansson.Und während die Live-Shows dahinliefen - inklusive einer speziellen Back-to-Back „Psychocandy-Tour“ - blieb die Aussicht auf ein neues Album unerfüllt. Die Herausforderungen waren vielfältig: Meinungsverschiedenheiten darüber, wo und wie sie das neue Album aufnehmen sollten, zusammen mit Jims Zurückhaltung, ein komfortables, aber ruhiges Leben mit seiner jungen Familie zurückzulassen, um Monate im Ausland zu verbringen. Schließlich eröffneten sie einfach diese neue Reise und sie begannen im September 2015 an „Damage and Joy“ (ein Hinweis auf die englische Übersetzung von Schadenfreude) zu arbeiten.Die Neuigkeiten über das bevorstehende Album verbreitete Alan McGee - jetzt wieder ihr Manager - im November 2016 und der Lead-Track „Amputation“ entstand nur wenige Wochen später. „Damage and Joy“ beurteilt fachmännisch den prekären Ausgleichsakt, der sowohl wachsen als auch dem Geist treu bleiben muss, der die Phantasie der Menschen zum ersten Mal erobert hat. Williams `All Things Must Pass` ist eine raffinierte re-energetisierte Version des Liedes, die zuvor auf „Upside Down: The Best of The Jesus and Mary Chain“ erschienen ist, in denen sich die Märchen des hedonistischen Überflusses gleichzeitig wie ein Hilferuf und eine Erweiterung ihres schwarzen Humors anfühlen.Endlich sind sie wieder live in Österreich mit ihrem neuen Album `Take A Rest` im Gepäck!","artists":[{"id":5760,"name":"The Jesus and Mary
