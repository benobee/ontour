Street - the hub of Masterton's burgeoning music scene, will be the location of a major live extravaganza on Labour Weekend as The Black Seeds, The Wellington International Ukulele Orchestra, King Ori Ori & the Masterons, Adam Page and Shapeshifter's DJ Sambora headline the town's inaugural Huia Festival.\r\nTaking place on Saturday October 25 the event will see the entire street closed off to traffic and opened up to 2000 people for a feast of music and entertainment plus a wide array of food and beverages all served up in an area dedicated to al-fresco dining.\r\nThe brainchild of NZ musician Warren Maxwell (who will be performing with the Masterons) and his brother Alan - who is also bar manager of the town's hugely successful venue King Street Live - the festival takes its name from the Huia bird whose last known sighting was in Wairarapa before its extinction in the early 20th century.\r\n\"With this festival\", says Warren Maxwell, \"we hope to resurrect the beauty of the Huia and celebrate it's significance to the area but we also want to help uplift the CBD of Masterton and give locals and the many visitors from out of town who'll be coming along the opportunity to celebrate this beautiful corner of New Zealand. A lot of the bigger outdoor events seem to gravitate towards the vineyards of Martinborough and Masterton always seems to miss out. But all this is set to change with Huia and we believe this kind of street festival will have a appeal that will draw people in thanks to its eclectic line-up and Mardi Gras vibe.","artists":[{"id":34847,"name":"The Black

cream of New Zealand’s Roots scene create a melting pot of super-human summertastic proportions when they unite this December for a tour de force of tri-coloured vibes.\r\n\r\nThe Black Seeds Katchafire, & Sons Of Zion take to the nation’s sunny circuit, with the summer caravan rolling off the blocks on Friday 27 December in Coroglen with their infectious blend of soul, afro funk and dub infused with a dose of the capital’s windy city groove The Black Seeds have created a HUGE national following. Since forming in the late 90s they have released five albums and have made serious inroads internationally including extensive tours of the US and are a major festival draw in Europe.

Described by one German magazine as the greatest band of their type in the world, in the recent winter months they have been creating tracks for their much anticipated sixth album, due for release next year.\r\n\r\nKatchafire took themselves back to North America in September and October for twenty four shows. Extensive voyagers afar, they have also built a reputation as one of the hardest working NZ bands with their exhaustive touring schedules. With two generations of family in its ranks, Katachafire began rather humbly in the Waikato when members of the Bell family rallied some friends together to jam some favourites Father Grenville Bell still leads the band on guitar with sons Logan and Jordan on vocals and drums respectively. .\r\n\r\nNew guys on the block Sons Of Zion have come a long way since their start in a Botany Downs garage in 2006.

Their music is irresistable mixing reggae with funk, soul, Afro-beat and other worldbeat sounds. The Black Seeds are no strangers to Canada's west coast. The Black Seeds were one of the featured acts at Victoria's 11th Annual Ska Festival and now six years later the band is making a comeback! \n\nThey'll be joined by Western Standard Time Ska Orchestra who are one of North America's premier ska orchestras. The band brings together the best West Coast ska, reggae, and jazz musicians of the last 20 years – to pay tribute to The Skatalites, the extremely influential Jamaican band that has been credited for inventing ska and paved the way for rocksteady and reggae. The band features past and present members of Hepcat, The Aggrolites, Brian Setzer Orchestra, The Debonaires and more + guest musicians from regional bands TBA.

Find your perfect wine & food match at one of the gourmet food stalls, who will be serving up everything from fresh strawberries and ice-cream to just landed seafood. Or head over to one of the nine top local restaurants for a more substantial offering.  Festival features include the Wine Seminar Lounge, where five top wine experts present a series of free seminars, complete with tastings - or catch the country's best culinary talent demonstrating a range of dishes, live in the Cooking Theatre.  Or just grab a glass and chill out under the trees, listening to some top music acts.","artists":[{"id":34847,"name":"The Black

Building on the growing success of the first two festivals, the 2018 line-up showcases a diverse range of local and international music from energetic folk and indie rock to Japanese banjo, brass and Balkan madness! Iconic New Zealand band The Black Seeds will bring their contemporary groove reggae rhythms, following the release of their new album Fabric. Singer/songwriter Nadia Reid (nominated for an Apra Silver Scrolls Award for her song Richard earlier this year) joins the line-up straight back from her UK/European tour, and the Hot Potato Band (Aus) blend world music influences with an Australian edge to create a sound of brass and drums ‘known to cause a severe case of happy fever’. Other international offerings are George & Noriko (Jap/Aus) with a unique sound of Japanese banjo blues, their energetic and original music earning them a place as finalists on Australia’s Got Talent 2012 and favourites at CubaDupa 2017. My Baby (NZ/Nld) join us from Amsterdam with their roots driven hypnotic dance music, and The Young Folk (Ire) have a sound which has seen them compared with Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver and Crosby Stills & Nash. Jordie Lane and the Sleepers (Aus) play psychedelic rock reminiscent of The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper. Our highly acclaimed homegrown talent includes Louis Baker with neo soul sounds, joined by his new band boasting some of the tightest, funkiest, and most solid of rhythm sections in the Wellington music scene. Mermaidens offer a mesmerising dip into the realms of post-punk and psych, and current radio favourites Glass Vaults blend subtle electronics and pulsating percussion to create a unique brand of transcendental psychedelic pop. The Frank Burkitt Band draw upon influences from folk, jazz, blues, swing, soul and all things American Roots, and Neko Ne Zna bring an energetic Balkan Gypsy brass extravaganza. On home turf in Kapiti are Jeep Road who play a mix of contemporary blues and soul.   The music and dancing will continue into the night, with the Coastella After Party (R18), with Rhombus in Dub bringing their big rolling sound and lively stage show and Olmecha Supreme featuring New Zealandʻs champion Rap Boxer \"King Home Boy\" and Captain Imon Starr. Coastella features a main stage set in a natural grassy amphitheatre, a lake stage offering an idyllic setting to relax with friends, and Tiny Town returns, the 10 foot shipping container converted into an intimate musical venue, offering a chance to get up close and personal with some of the bands. Food vendors will once again be hand-picked by Visa Wellington On A Plate. With its stellar line up and unique natural setting, Coastella is a chance to enjoy a summer musical discovery in the heart of Kapiti. A limited 500 Adult and 100 Family Early Bird tickets are now on sale from Eventfinda until sold out. Tickets are limited so pre-booking is recommended. Coastella Festival is at Southward Car Museum, on Saturday 17 Feb 2018 and is being produced with funding from Kapiti Coast District Council. Return buses will travel from the Wellington CBD.

We bring together a remarkable group of yoga and meditation instructors, musical performers, speakers, artists, and chefs for a transformational retreat in one of the world’s most awe-inspiring natural resorts.  Your experience may start on your mat, on a mountain trail, or on the dancefloor, but Wanderlust will get into your mind, body and soul. It may start in your ears, whether from the inspirational words of a speaker or the pulse-pounding beats of a musical artist. It may begin in your eyes, as you drink in the surrounding natural beauty or learn to align a challenging pose. It may start in your heart, as you make new friends or experience the joy of trying something you’ve never dared to do.  Regardless of what starts you on your path, Wanderlust is an experience that will leave you different than when you came — with new ideas, new friends, newly discovered abilities, and greater peace.
