released its first album in sixteen years: We Got It From Here, Thank You for Your Service. A new album from Tribe was long-rumored and hoped for, but the veteran hip-hop group had splintered, and its members were busy with solo careers and side projects. With We Got It, Tribe proved not only that fences could truly be mended, but also that the musical team’s skills and social consciousness are as potent as ever. With this final recording of Phife Dawg, as well as the group’s renewed energy and mastery, Tribe — and its mission — go on. Hallelujah.","artists":[{"id":665,"name":"A Tribe Called
