With a host of thrilling activities from soft play and circus skills to go-carts and glitter, there’s plenty of excitement for kids of all ages. Plus, there are kids’ shows and performances on the Castle Stage and in the Big Top, daring antics to be had at the Freesports Park, and fairytale escapism in the Dingly Dell.\nCamp Bestival’s amazing music line-up is curated by renowned music specialist Rob da Bank whose penchant for eclecticism has seen the legendary likes of Chuck Berry, Basement Jaxx, Madness & Blondie playing alongside hordes of up and coming acts that we’ve given a nurturing nudge on their way to stardom, including Florence & the Machine, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Mumford & Sons, London Grammar, Clean Bandit and Gabrielle Aplin, amongst many others. From folk and dub to drumstep and jazz jungle, there’s guaranteed to be something to get you and the kids throwing shapes long into the summer evenings. \nWith a consummate arts programme that offers the best in contemporary theatre, performance, spoken word and discussions, there is a wealth of entertaining wonder and intellectual nourishment for all ages to get stuck into. Add to that amazing street eats and gourmet treats, fantastic campsite facilities (we’re the first ever festival to offer reserved camping plots at a festival with Camping Plus, and the option to indulge in an array of fantastic Boutique Camping options), all sprinkled liberally with Camp Bestival’s own inimitable brand of magic and you have a unique start to the summer holidays and the ultimate family festival experience.\nThe wonderful world of Bestival was born out of ten fun years of pioneering music events and record releases from Rob da Bank's Sunday Best empire.

He moved to London before his teenage years and began making music from a young age. Jay’s naturally curious mind led him to start learning the cello. He then began playing the guitar at a few years after. Jay started listening to artists such as Bob Dylan, Paolo Nutini, and Ben Howard from his early teens, and as a result their influences can often be seen in his original works.\n\nJay eventually began writing his own original songs, then a year later, he started busking on the streets of London, and another a year later, He began performing at pubs and venues. A few months after Jay started playing to live crowds in various venues, he decided to leave his previous career plans of becoming a doctor behind, and decided to become a full-time and musician.\n\nJay is a resident artist at the world-famous Roundhouse venue in London, and is currently working on an EP.\n\nAnnie Rew Shaw\n\nAnnie Rew Shaw is a pianist, singer and songwriter from Devon. \n\nInspired by the likes of Bon Iver, Daughter and Lykke Li, Annie's music has a distinct combination of powerful, classic songwriting with a dark, melancholic edge.\n\n“A stunning performer and an incredible vocalist” - James Santer, BBC Introducing\n\n“Songs about sorrow and heartache, words struck with such emotion with vocals so elegant and heart-driven... powerful and captivating” - The Flux\n\nKate Williams & Dave Thorpe\n\nKate and Dave met over a scarred ukulele in a music therapy centre... all is now well with it and them. A shared obsession for ukes and mandolins, discovery of their diverse musical backgrounds and some peculiar common ground has led to them writing together, playing anything and everything from classical music to prog rock on two mandolins and recently beginning to record tracks for an album which will be available early in 2015.

It’s a Sunday afternoon and evening packed with live music and entertainment, with some bands you know and some you don’t but all with that Hot Vox Magic. \n\nA hot spot for the glitterati, having hosted Paloma Faith, Sadie Frost, Boy George and Roisin Murphy (to name but a few), it takes the best of contemporary music, art and entertainment to a new level.

Festivities start from 2.30pm and see us right through to 10pm and did I mention it was FREE ENTRY?  So stuff yourself with ‘All The Trimmings’ before that last roast potato is lost to you forever.","artists":[{"id":461880,"name":"Jay Johnson","mbid":"e476cc13-e3dd-48b7-99f7-0862921371d5","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8060545.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8060545.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JayJohnson/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jay%20Johnson/930166750400314","tracker_count":574,"url":"JayJohnson","website":"http://www.jayjohnsonmusic.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Hot Vox Presents Jay Johnson @ Paradise","place":"Paradise By Way Of Kensal Green","city":"London","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.529056,"longitude":-0.216264},"ontour_id":"rkQhR3TpseXYCCJhf","genres":[]},{"id":12421569,"artist_id":461880,"artist_event_id":15539360,"title":"Jay Johnson @ The Big Feastival in Kingham, United Kingdom","datetime":"2016-08-27T17:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, August 27, 2016 at 5:00PM","formatted_location":"Kingham, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12421569?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jay+Johnson&came_from=67","description":"A festival of first-class food and top-notch live music, raising funds for the Jamie Oliver Food Foundation. 26 - 28 August 2016","artists":[{"id":461880,"name":"Jay Johnson","mbid":"e476cc13-e3dd-48b7-99f7-0862921371d5","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8060545.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8060545.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JayJohnson/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jay%20Johnson/930166750400314","tracker_count":574,"url":"JayJohnson","website":"http://www.jayjohnsonmusic.com"}],"venue":{"name":"The Big Feastival","place":"Alex James' Farm, The Cotswolds","city":"Kingham","region":"E6","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.9,"longitude":-1.6166667},"ontour_id":"rkQhR3TpseXYCCJhf","genres":[]},{"id":12792516,"artist_id":461880,"artist_event_id":16047412,"title":"Jay Johnson @ An Evening with Mindful Music in London, United Kingdom","datetime":"2016-09-15T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"London, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12792516?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jay+Johnson&came_from=67","description":"Excited to announce that I'll be performing at a fundraiser gig organised by Mindful Music on the 15th of September.

He additionally won BBC Radio 1Xtra’s Homegrown competition enabling him to firmly gain the recognition of music industry peers.\n\nLeslie describes making the transition from producer to artist, “as a natural progression that was bound to happen sooner or later, down to a fascination of different modes of music expression”. This has enabled him to draw from his experience of growing up in a multi-cultural, gritty and evolving area to compose thought-provoking uplifting lyrics and song.\n\nAfter honing his live skills over the last couple of years relentlessly gigging the musical circuit, he has managed to build an ever growing loyal fan base. With momentum building, Leslie will be releasing his eagerly anticipated debut EP in summer 2017.\n\nLISTEN: http://bit.ly/2o5PXNN\n\nMiss Morose\n(Folk)\nFinding the blend between sad folk and alternative, jangly rock, Miss Morose narrates her perspective of the world from the clouds.

Jay started listening to artists such as Bob Dylan, Paolo Nutini, and Ben Howard from his early teens, and as a result their influences can often be seen in his original works. ​ Jay eventually began writing his own original songs, then a year later, he started busking on the streets of London, and another a year later, he began performing at pubs and venues. A few months after Jay started playing to live crowds in various venues, he decided to leave his previous career plans of becoming a doctor behind, and decided to become a full-time musician.","artists":[{"id":461880,"name":"Jay Johnson","mbid":"e476cc13-e3dd-48b7-99f7-0862921371d5","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8060545.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8060545.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/JayJohnson/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jay%20Johnson/930166750400314","tracker_count":574,"url":"JayJohnson","website":"http://www.jayjohnsonmusic.com"}],"venue":{"name":"Music on the Farm","place":"Vauxhall City Farm","city":"London","region":null,"country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.487261,"longitude":-0.119321},"ontour_id":"rkQhR3TpseXYCCJhf","genres":[]},{"id":15447571,"artist_id":461880,"artist_event_id":19736995,"title":"Jay Johnson @ AirBnB Experience in London, United Kingdom","datetime":"2017-09-09T20:30:41","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:30PM","formatted_location":"London, United Kingdom","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15447571?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Jay+Johnson&came_from=67","description":"Discover London’s freshest singer-songwriter talent in one of its oldest bars.
