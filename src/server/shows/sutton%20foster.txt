Don't Tell Me! host Peter Sagal walk into a bar... No, it's not the start of a joke. It's the essence of Ask Me Another, a rambunctious hour that blends brainteasers and local pub trivia night with comedy and music. Host Ophira Eisenberg invites in-studio guests and listeners alike to stretch their noggins, tickle their funny bones, and enjoy witty banter and guitar riffs from house musician Jonathan Coulton.\n\nFor an hour, listeners can play along as Eisenberg puts questions to a rotating band of puzzle gurus, audience members and special mystery guests, who then takes a turn in the contestant's chair facing trivia games written especially for him or her. What you'll hear resembles the casual intimacy of game night at a friend's house: one where scores are forgotten in favor of hilarious gaffes.\n\nAsk Me Another is recorded live at The Bell House in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nAsk Me Another is a co-production of NPR and WNYC.","artists":[{"id":61644,"name":"Sutton Foster","mbid":"bcea90b0-d7d7-4b94-a31d-5d10c58bc053","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/8010709.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/8010709.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/SuttonFoster/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sutton%20Foster/148567528538528","tracker_count":8419,"url":"SuttonFoster","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Ask Me Another -
