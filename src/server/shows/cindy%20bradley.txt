The recognition this eight track collection brought, led to a record deal with Trippin' n' Rhythm that garnered the critically acclaimed 'Bloom' and then followed up with 'Unscripted'. Both were built around the basic constructs of Bradley's velvety tones. Now Cindy takes to The American Theatre stage to share her past hits as well as her latest Trippin' n' Rhythm project, 'Bliss'. Alex Bugnon, nephew of the late jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd, grew up going to the Montreux Jazz Festival in his hometown in Switzerland. He attended the Paris Conservatory of Music for two years, then moved to the U.S. and went to the Berklee School of Music, meanwhile performing as an accompanist to gospel groups. For the last two decades, jazz keyboardist Alex Bugnon has been a romantic yet energetic force on the jazz scene.
