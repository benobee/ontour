Ever since she burst on the scene as a fresh-faced teenager bringing contemporary Christian music to the forefront of American culture, the Nashville native gained a reputation for creating potent songs that examined life's complexities with an open heart and keen eye. She became the first artist in Christian music to have a platinum record and went on to become a crossover sensation, her musical gifts transcending genre boundaries to make her a household name.\n\n- See more at: http://www.albertabairtheater.org/event-detail/611/Amy-Grant/#sthash.DGui8hhf.dpuf","artists":[{"id":1461,"name":"Amy Grant","mbid":"3cd18a93-1797-4bbb-9b8a-c096d5e7864c","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6984252.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6984252.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AmyGrant/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/amygrant","tracker_count":177557,"url":"AmyGrant","website":"http://www.amygrant.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Alberta Bair Theater","place":"Alberta Bair Theater","city":"Billings","region":"MT","country":"United States","latitude":45.78383,"longitude":-108.507584},"ontour_id":"emA4xyseHfNNfqi3s","genres":["adult standards","ccm","christian alternative rock","christian christmas","christian music","christian rock","christmas","operatic pop","pop christmas","worship"]},{"id":13863929,"artist_id":1461,"artist_event_id":17540033,"title":"Amy Grant @ Jensen Grand Concert Hall in Pocatello, ID","datetime":"2017-05-18T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Pocatello, ID","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/13863929?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Amy+Grant&came_from=67","description":"Amy Grant\n*Rescheduled due to illness.

More details to give all of you FOA members a little bit more information.\n\nAMY GRANT - ALASKA CRUISE\nJuly 8 - 15, 2017\n\nSEVEN DAYS & SEVEN NIGHTS CRUISING ALASKA with nightly concerts, and many many other private sessions and events with AMY GRANT.\n\nPORTS:\n* Vancouver, BC, Canada (Embark)\n* Cruising TRACY ARM\n* Juneau, AK (potentially a special concert for the people of Juneau while in port)\n* Skagway, AK\n* Ketchikan, AK\n* Cruising GLACIER BAY\n* Vancouver, BC, Canada (Debark)\nFRIENDS / GUEST SPEAKERS PERFORMERS:\n* TBA, probably announced at Amy's Creative Discovery Weekend or after.\nSHIP: MS Nieuw Amsterdam (Holland America)\n\nHOW TO BOOK:\n* Starting today around 12 noon eastern we will post a link to the reservation system. You MUST book through our reservation system in order to attend and have access to Amy's cruise events. If you have your own travel agent that you use for a cruise you CAN NOT use them to book this cruise and have access to the content that Amy and her team are going to provide. \n* Deposits are $500 per person and you can book your cabin today. Final full payment will be due on March 30, 2017. That gives 8 months for you to make payments however it fits your budget.\n* There will be limited space as the size of the main theater on the ship will dictate the size of the group that can attend the cruise (approximately 850 people total).\n\nPASSPORT WILL BE REQUIRED:\n* Cruise is going to start in Vancouver, BC, Canada so you will need a passport to get there and also to get on the ship. No exceptions.\nSHIP IS 100% ADA COMPLIANT: \n* All events will be 100% accessible\n\nNEED A ROOMMATE?\n* All pricing that you will see is based on double occupancy. If you are a single cruiser and want a roommate, call our reservation company and they will assist you. Also I do recommend that you use Friends of Amy and the EVENT GROUP (I'll post a link later for you all so you can have the discussion there).\nWHAT TYPE OF A CABIN SHOULD YOU BOOK:\n* There are NUMEROUS types of cabins at a wide variety of pricing. If you're concerned about the pricing and on a budget - I recommend the inside cabins. Staying in one of those cabins is the most economical way of taking the trip and you will not miss ANYTHING. When I have gone on other similar cruises I find I'm NEVER in my room other than to sleep... and guess what. When you turn the lights out, all of the cabins look the same (DARK).\n* If you want something a little more luxurious of course they have those too.\n\n\nWHY A CRUISE? \n* WHY NOT? Here's the thing about cruising if you've never done it... you unpack ONCE and go to 5 or 6 different places in a week. How is that NOT awesome. All of your food is included (trust me there's PLENTY and Holland America's food is the best in industry).\n* We've done 2 and 3 night weekends here in Nashville with a big group of people before. We always end up feeling like we wish we had another day or 2 or 3. Well, this gives us that. After every weekend by the SUNDAY morning we start seeing some really great friendships being formed just in time for you to say GOODBYE to one another. \n* On a cruise we get to spend more time together enjoying each other, discovering things about each other and did I mention more Amy Grant concerts? More unique storytelling moments? JUST MORE OF EVERYTHING (did I mention the food... and the ice cream machine?)\n* This cruise is almost entirely inside what they call the INSIDE PASSAGE. Which means... the boat doesn't move much at all. So if you're worried about sea-sickness or anything like that, it's really akin to cruising in a wide river. There's just not much space for the waves to get moving. It's the best way to do this if that is a concern.\n* There will be nightly concerts, almost every morning there will be MORNING activities... and many other special \"events\" during our days on the water. But when we get into port we're going to want you to explore these unique and amazing stops. They are definitely the coolest cruise ports around.\n\nWHY ALASKA?\n* Because it's generally just awesome! The beauty of the creation around you just heightens EVERYTHING.\n* One time back in 2007 on the first Cruise I ever went on I'm sitting on the ship and a Bald Eagle landed right next to me... ok actually about 25 yards from me, but it was unbelievable.\n* We want you to escape your world for a week.\n* We want you to go somewhere that you might have never thought you'd go.\n* We want you to join Amy on an adventure that we/she never thought she'd do with a group like this.\n* We didn't want to do something DIFFERENT than the weekends that we've done in the past. We will likely do another Nashville Weekend at some point, but it's important to Amy and her team that we give people different experiences.\nNow Accepting Reservations Here: http://www.inspirationcruises.com/christian-cruise/amy-grant-alaska-2017","artists":[{"id":1461,"name":"Amy Grant","mbid":"3cd18a93-1797-4bbb-9b8a-c096d5e7864c","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6984252.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6984252.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AmyGrant/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/amygrant","tracker_count":177557,"url":"AmyGrant","website":"http://www.amygrant.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Amy Grant's Alaska Cruise","place":"MS Nieuw Amsterdam","city":"Vancouver","region":"02","country":"Canada","latitude":49.25,"longitude":-123.1333333},"ontour_id":"emA4xyseHfNNfqi3s","genres":["adult standards","ccm","christian alternative rock","christian christmas","christian music","christian rock","christmas","operatic pop","pop christmas","worship"]},{"id":15427236,"artist_id":1461,"artist_event_id":19710019,"title":"Amy Grant @ Trine University in Angola, IN","datetime":"2017-09-16T20:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Saturday, September 16, 2017 at 8:00PM","formatted_location":"Angola, IN","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/15427236?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Amy+Grant&came_from=67","description":"","artists":[{"id":1461,"name":"Amy Grant","mbid":"3cd18a93-1797-4bbb-9b8a-c096d5e7864c","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6984252.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6984252.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AmyGrant/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/amygrant","tracker_count":177557,"url":"AmyGrant","website":"http://www.amygrant.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Trine University","place":"Trine University","city":"Angola","region":"IN","country":"United States","latitude":41.6348127,"longitude":-85.0057905},"ontour_id":"emA4xyseHfNNfqi3s","genres":["adult standards","ccm","christian alternative rock","christian christmas","christian music","christian rock","christmas","operatic pop","pop christmas","worship"]},{"id":14603636,"artist_id":1461,"artist_event_id":18580328,"title":"Amy Grant @ Norsk Hostfest 2017 in Minot, ND","datetime":"2017-09-28T13:00:00","formatted_datetime":"Thursday, September 28, 2017 at 1:00PM","formatted_location":"Minot, ND","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/14603636?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Amy+Grant&came_from=67","description":"Amy will be one of hte headline artists at the Norsk Hostfest 2017 in Minot, ND\n\nTicket Information:\n* Get Tickets Here:  http://protected.tickets.com/buy/TicketOnsale?agency=NORSK_PRESALE2&orgid=42609&poid=157218\n* Pre-Sale Password:  mercy\n* Pre-Sale Ends:  May 17 @ 9 pm","artists":[{"id":1461,"name":"Amy Grant","mbid":"3cd18a93-1797-4bbb-9b8a-c096d5e7864c","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6984252.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6984252.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/AmyGrant/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":"https://www.facebook.com/amygrant","tracker_count":177557,"url":"AmyGrant","website":"http://www.amygrant.com/"}],"venue":{"name":"Norsk Hostfest 2017","place":"Norsk Hostfest 2017","city":"Minot","region":"ND","country":"United States","latitude":48.2325,"longitude":-101.2958333},"ontour_id":"emA4xyseHfNNfqi3s","genres":["adult standards","ccm","christian alternative rock","christian christmas","christian music","christian rock","christmas","operatic pop","pop christmas","worship"]},{"id":15149137,"artist_id":1461,"artist_event_id":19328712,"title":"Amy Grant @ Christmas with Amy Grant and Michael W.
