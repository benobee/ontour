released his debut album 99.9% with wide acclaim, most of which is directed to his slick production combining hip hop, Chicago house, and soul. At only 23, the Haitian-born, Montreal-based Louis Kevin Celestin has already gotten the attention of fans and collaborators, who include Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano, Anderson . Paak, BADBADNOTGOOD, and Karriem Riggins. And even without the accolades of super famous fans like Madonna, Kaytranada's music speaks for itself, and will prove to be anything but a flavor of the month in the coming years. Dig on his music for yourself, and come out to the Observatory tonight, which will surely be packed with diehard fans of various ages.","artists":[{"id":2800116,"name":"River

L’équilibre entre pop urbaine, indie r’n’b romantique et future house introspective de ce “James Blake canadien” en fait l’une des découvertes les plus excitantes de l’année 2016.\n\nJESSY LANZA\nLa reine de la future soul est de retour. Jessy Lanza, garante de la “face lumineuse” du label anglais Hyperdub, a affiné encore un peu plus sa formule avec un nouvel album oscillant entre italo-disco, footwork, electronica sensuelle et R’n’B version “sueurs froides”. Le pouvoir d’hypnose de Jessy sur un dancefloor, de fait, est implacable…\n\nCLAMS CASINO\nCe type a produit tout ce que la planète hip-hop US compte de génies, de Lil B à A$AP Rocky ou The Weeknd, avant de se retirer de l’échiquier pour mieux revenir en solo. Clams Casino s’assume ainsi en artiste à part entière, ses beats nébuleux et ses ambiances quasi fantômatiques étant soutenus par un puissant travail sur les basses.\n\nRYAN HEMSWORTH\nIncroyablement humain. C’est le point fort de Ryan Hemsworth, producteur de Nouvelle-Ecosse pourtant habitué aux expérimentations sonores ambitieuses, mais qui réussit toujours à mâtiner son R’n’B électronique d’une humeur soul aussi élégante que chaleureuse. Si la musique de Ryan Hemsworth se nourrit de mélancolie, elle sait aussi se parer d’une énergie dancefloor qui n’est pas uniquement celle du désespoir. Une énergie humaine, donc.","artists":[{"id":2800116,"name":"River

He first came to prominence in November 2014 with the heavily sought after deadmau5 ‘Aural Psynapse’ remix. It caused a tidal wave of speculation that ATTLAS was in fact a side project of the mau5 himself.  That speculation ended when he was officially ‘outed’ by Pete Tong , announcing ATTLAS is Jeff Hartford, Canadian producer, dj and classically trained musician. An incredible depth of influences from travelling, alongside music, film and art worlds have had a decided effect on his musical outpourings, which were all jazz, classical and guitars until trips to Amsterdam, Berlin and attending the homecoming ‘Meowington Hax’ 2k11 tour. As Jeff says himself: ‘From there, it was a musical attempt to synthesize my influences and aspirations as best as I could.’ But not content to fit the mold or cracking a ‘sound’ to repeat ever after, as anyone who’s followed him can attest to.  And boy has he been busy ever since. Three six track EP releases (Siren, Scene & Sin), a number of stand alone singles alongside a slew of high profile and wide ranging mixes have subsequently followed. Tove Lo, Aphex Twin and Rihanna’s ‘BBHMM’have all had the ATTLAS touch, with BBHMM voted 2nd best remix of 2015 (Billboard).  2016 has seen him touring and supporting with the likes of Nero, Zed’s Dead, Alison Wonderland and most recently joined deadmau5 himself for back to back sets and writing sessions on the North American mau5hax Bus Tour.  His first release ‘Aspen’ this year has set the tone for what’s to follow, with two further EPs and singles planned throughout the year alongside a number of key major artist productions and an ever growing set of festival dates it’s fair to say that ATTLAS is truly prolific!  ‘Completely original at a time when originality is in short supply’  ‘Sounds like the universe opening up and letting you know it’s okay to die’ – Siren EP\r\n\r\nATTLAS - Parallel Lines\r\nPlays: 1,483,816\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMNHMR \r\nFacebook  Twitter  Soundcloud\r\nARMNHMR is a duo hailing from Northern and Southern California, now based out of Los Angeles, CA.   A wide range of high energy sound, Joseph Chung and Joseph Abella have produced originals and remixes from eclectic to trap to future bass and everything in between.   They’ve received incredible support from Laidback Luke, Slander, and the Chainsmokers and are consistently pushing the boundaries of sound to make sure that everyone has a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Chainsmokers ft.
