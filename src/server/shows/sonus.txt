& Timbre present: \nWelcoming the Spring: An immersive audio and visual experience, welcoming the coming light. \nCome celebrate the light of spring with us! On this beautifully curated night, you will experience light projection by artist Stephen Proctor, complementary floral-themed drinks created especially for the night by Chris Cole, modern a capella music by Sonus, and original music by harpist, composer, and songwriter, Timbre. This night will feature special acoustic versions of songs from her acclaimed album, Sun & Moon, as she is accompanied by a string quartet and choir in the amazing acoustics of WELD's perfomance space.  \nThe climax of the night will be the world premiere of a new work by Timbre, \"Narsilion\".  A companion piece to her album, Sun & Moon, \"Narsilion\" explores the story of the creation of the sun and the moon in Middle Earth, inspired by the \"Silmarilion\" by JRR Tolkien. This new song will utilize choir, strings, and light projection, as it celebrates light being brought into the world. Those in attendance will have the exlusive chance to pre-order the vinyl release of this piece.  \nOpening the night will be a very special and unique aural experience, a capella choir Sonus. The acoustics in the performance space of WELD have almost an entire second of reverb, and that space will be filled with the unrivaled beauty of the human voice. Sonus specializes in modern and moving classical works, and they will be sharing works by such notable composers as Eric Whitacre and Ola Gjeilo, as well as others. They will also be joining Timbre in both songs from her album, and as apart of the premiere of \"Narsilion\". \nCome share in this unique night, and immersive yourself in the beauty of light. \nTickets will also be available at the door for $12. \n  \n  \n_________________________________________________________________ \n\nMORE ON NARSILION:\n\n\n\"As a child, I was incredibly fascinated by Tolkien's creations. I read The Lord of the Rings every year, and wanted to marry Legolas someday. \n\n\nNow, I am still captured by the beauty of Tolkien's works. As I was writing my lastest album, \"Sun & Moon\", I was immersing myself in different literature about night and day. I found myself re-reading Tolkien's \"Silmarillion\", and was completely captured by his creation story. \n\n\nIn the story, the world is lit by two trees, one whose golden dew lights the day, and the other lighting the night with silver flowers. In Tolkien's description of the creation of these sources of light, he says \"As is written in Narsilion, the song of the sun and the moon...\" and the proceeds to tell the story. However, he never actually quotes the song.\n\n\nTolkien scholars have looked for this song, but to no avail. Either he never wrote it, or it has been lost.\n\n\nI was enamoured with the idea of writing this lost song, an ancient song of the Elves celebrating light coming into the world, to light the way of men. I took all of Tolkien's elvish poetry, analyzed it, and wrote a poem based on his story, all written in his style. I then had it translated in Elvish, so that it can really feel like a lost song of Middle Earth.\n\n\nI am so excited to share this new piece, a perfect companion to Sun & Moon! It feels like something ancient, something mystical. It is my hope that I've captured even a fragment of the magic that Tolkien created.\"\n\n\n-Timbre Cierpke","artists":[{"id":677635,"name":"Sonus","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5255148.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5255148.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Sonus/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":6204,"url":"Sonus","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"WELD Nashville","place":"WELD Nashville","city":"Nashville","region":"TN","country":"United States","latitude":36.1277698,"longitude":-86.7689303},"ontour_id":"iPTpkTx8XjJbotmiF","genres":["early music ensemble"]},{"id":12017650,"artist_id":677635,"artist_event_id":14995264,"title":"Sonus @ Aquarius Zrće in Novalja, Croatia","datetime":"2016-08-21T19:30:00","formatted_datetime":"Sunday, August 21, 2016 at 7:30PM","formatted_location":"Novalja, Croatia","ticket_url":null,"ticket_type":null,"ticket_status":"unavailable","on_sale_datetime":null,"facebook_rsvp_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/event/12017650?app_id=ONTOUR_1638&artist=Sonus&came_from=67","description":null,"artists":[{"id":677635,"name":"Sonus","mbid":null,"image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5255148.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5255148.jpeg","facebook_tour_dates_url":"http://www.bandsintown.com/Sonus/facebookapp?came_from=67","facebook_page_url":null,"tracker_count":6204,"url":"Sonus","website":null}],"venue":{"name":"Aquarius Zrće","place":"Aquarius Zrće","city":"Novalja","region":null,"country":"Croatia","latitude":44.56654,"longitude":14.8755},"ontour_id":"iPTpkTx8XjJbotmiF","genres":["early music ensemble"]}]
